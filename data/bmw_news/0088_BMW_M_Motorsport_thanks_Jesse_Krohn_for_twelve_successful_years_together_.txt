"BMW M Motorsport Junior of the Year": Jesse Krohn, then
  aged 24, first attracted attention with this title at the end of the
  2014 season. He had prevailed against three competitors in the first
  year of the then talent promotion programme and started his career as
  a member of the BMW M Motorsport family from that point on. His first
  stops were the ADAC GT Masters and the Nürburgring 24 Hours. In
  2017/2018, he celebrated his first title win in the GT class of the
  Asian Le Mans Series.

In 2016, Krohn drove in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship
  for the first time, where he celebrated many of his greatest successes
  in the following years. In 2019, he enjoyed the special experience of
  competing in the Daytona 24 Hours together with Alessandro Zanardi
  (ITA) at the wheel of the BMW M8 GTE. A year later, he triumphed in
  the GTLM class at the US endurance classic and also became IMSA
  Michelin Endurance Cup champion together with John Edwards (USA) at
  the end of the season. In 2024, Krohn joined the BMW M Motorsport
  Hypercar programme and contested the entire IMSA season in the BMW M
  Hybrid V8 of BMW M Team RLL. He won the "Battle on the
  Bricks" in Indianapolis (USA) together with Philipp Eng (AUT).

The 2025 season brought Krohn another milestone in his career – his
  first overall victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. He also won the
  3-hour race of the GT World Challenge Europe on the Grand Prix circuit
  in the Eifel. After twelve years, Krohn is one of the longest-serving
  members of the BMW M Motorsport family.

: "I would
  like to thank Jesse Krohn very much for the past twelve years at BMW M
  Motorsport. During the time we worked together, I got to know him as a
  very reliable racing driver who always gave his all for his job. This
  professional attitude has led him to great successes – be it with the
  BMW M8 GTE at Daytona, with the BMW M Hybrid V8 at Indianapolis or
  most recently with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO at the Nürburgring. It is
  impressive to see how incredibly far he has come from being a junior
  driver. Jesse Krohn's career at BMW M Motorsport is a prime example of
  successful promotion of young talent. He and everyone involved can be
  very proud of this. Jesse will now be taking on new challenges. I wish
  him all the best for this!"

"It has been a long, successful
  time at BMW M Motorsport and I am very grateful for all the
  opportunities it has given me. BMW M Motorsport has given me the
  chance to become a professional racing driver and I have had the
  privilege of being part of most of BMW M Motorsport's top racing
  programmes after winning the Junior Programme in 2014. I have competed
  in over 200 races around the world with great teams and team-mates and
  have had many successes along the way. All good things come to an end,
  but new and exciting challenges await me. I would like to thank all
  the teams, team-mates and all the BMW M Motorsport staff I have had
  the pleasure of working with over the past twelve years. I wish
  everyone all the best for the future and every success for 2026. I
  will miss you, but we will meet again on the race track in the future."
