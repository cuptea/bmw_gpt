The year of the BMW M Hybrid V8 began with an impressive streak
  of four consecutive pole positions by Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the IMSA
  WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. At the end of the third season of
  the Hypercar in North America, the results included four poles, a 1-2
  finish at Road America (USA), and two third-places at Long Beach and
  Laguna Seca (both USA). In the drivers' standings, Vanthoor and
  Philipp Eng (AUT) finished fourth. The FIA WEC season also started
  strongly with a front-row start in Qatar and second place in the race
  at Imola (ITA). However, the second half of the season was
  disappointing for BMW M Team WRT.

The BMW M Hybrid V8 completed over
  70,000 racing kilometres in the 2025 season, approximately 39,000 in
  the FIA WEC and around 31,000 in the IMSA Series. During 36 test days,
  nearly 33,000 test kilometres were covered – around 23,000 in the FIA
  WEC and approximately 10,000 in the IMSA Series.

The 2025 season with the BMW M4 GT3 was almost a continuous
  triumph. It began in February with a 1-2 finish at the Bathurst 12
  Hour (AUS), the last race of the old model. The EVO version seamlessly
  continued the success story. The highlight was ROWE Racing's victory
  at the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER), marking BMW M Motorsport's 21st
  overall win in the "Green Hell". Other major individual
  successes with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO included Team WRT's wins at the
  Suzuka 1000KM (JPN) and the Indianapolis 8 Hour (USA), as well as Paul
  Miller Racing's triumphs in the GTD-PRO class at the 6 Hours of the
  Glen and Petit Le Mans (both USA). Key title wins in 2025 included the
  drivers' and teams' titles in the GT World Challenge Europe with Team
  WRT, as well as the drivers' and manufacturers' titles in the
  Intercontinental GT Challenge, where BMW M Motorsport achieved four
  wins in five season races. Additionally, the GTD-PRO drivers', teams',
  and manufacturers' titles in the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup were
  secured. Driver of the season was Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). In his
  debut year as a BMW M works driver, he won the 24h Nürburgring and the
  drivers' titles in the GT World Challenge Europe (Overall and Sprint
  standings) and the Intercontinental GT Challenge.

56 BMW M4 GT3s were in action
  worldwide during the 2025 season, most of them EVO models. More than
  80 victories and 100 additional podium finishes were achieved, and
  over 400,000 racing kilometres were completed.

The smaller sibling of the BMW M4 GT3 also achieved impressive
  successes in the 2025 season. The biggest triumphs came at the
  Nürburgring. At the 24-hour race, Team AV Racing by BLACK FALCON won
  the SP10 class with the EVO version of the car. FK Performance
  Motorsport triumphed in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) in nine
  out of ten races in the SP8T category, securing the overall NLS
  victory for drivers Nick Wüstenhagen (GER) and Ranko Mijatovic (SUI).
  While titles were not achieved in the major European GT4 racing series
  – the GT European Series and ADAC GT4 Germany – the BMW M4 GT4 EVO
  dominated in GT4 America across all classes. Thanks to consistently
  strong results from GT4 teams, BMW M Motorsport secured the SRO
  manufacturers' title in the GT4 class.

88 BMW M4 GT4s were in racing
  action worldwide in 2025. They achieved over 100 victories and around
  150 additional podium finishes. BMW M Motorsport teams covered
  approximately 330,000 racing kilometres.

BMW M Motorsport is also highly active in virtual racing, and
  its three automotive gaming teams continued their success streak in
  2025. The highlight was the Esports World Cup (EWC), a four-day
  competition on the "Rennsport" platform. BMW M Team Redline
  triumphed for the second consecutive time with drivers Luke Bennett
  (GBR), Sebastian Job (GBR), Jeffrey Rietveld (NED), and Kevin Siggy (SLO).

"Overall, we at BMW M Motorsport look back on a very successful
  2025 season. Many thanks to everyone whose hard work contributed to
  this record. With our BMW M Hybrid V8, the conclusion is mixed. In the
  first half of the season, we were very satisfied with the car's pace
  in both the IMSA Series and the FIA WEC. Unfortunately, we were unable
  to achieve the corresponding race results. While we celebrated the 1-2
  finish at Road America in the second half of the season, we generally
  had higher expectations. We will analyse in detail over the winter
  what caused this, so we can return much stronger in 2026 with the
  updated version of our car. With the BMW M4 GT3, we had an almost
  dream season. The title wins in some of the most important GT3 racing
  series and the individual victories at the Nürburgring and Bathurst
  were major highlights. In the DTM, we fought for the title until the
  last race and stood on the podium multiple times in the FIA WEC. I am
  also very pleased with the BMW M4 GT4's strong performance. This car
  symbolises our close connection to customer racing, whose heart lies
  in the GT4 category. In 2026, the BMW M2 Racing will be added as a new
  entry-level car, completing our portfolio of customer racing cars. I
  can't wait for the action to resume in January after a well-deserved
  Christmas break."
