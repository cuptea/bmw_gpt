The new Cell Recycling Competence
  Center (CRCC) in Salching in Lower Bavaria has now been officially
  commissioned – marking a major step forward in implementing innovative
  direct recycling as a joint project between the BMW Group and Encory
  GmbH. For construction and operation of the new Competence Center, the
  BMW Group and Encory are relying on regional partners.

Direct recycling allows residual materials from battery cell
  production, including complete battery cells, to be mechanically
  dismantled. The raw materials are not entirely reverted to their
  original state, but are instead “directly” fed back into the cell
  production cycle. This direct recycling methodology, developed by
  experts from the BMW Group, therefore eliminates the conventional,
  energy-intensive chemical or thermal processing previously required.
  At the new CRCC, direct recycling will be scaled up and introduced in
  stages until, once fully operational, the annual volume of battery
  cell material recycled will be in the mid-double-digit tonne range.
  Going forward, the recovered raw materials will be directly reused in
  pilot production of battery cells at the company’s own Cell
  Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) in Parsdorf.

“Our direct recycling process puts us at the forefront of the
  industry,” explains Markus Fallböhmer, SVP of Battery Production at
  BMW AG. “This technology has tremendous potential to further optimise
  battery cell production.” It is also conceivable that, for the first
  time, cell manufacturers could be enabled to use direct recycling in
  series production.

An existing hall in Salching in Lower Bavaria (Straubing-Bogen
  district) will be used for the new Competence Center. In addition to
  the production area and warehouse space of around 2,100 m², the
  building also offers just under 350 m² of offices and break rooms, as
  well as photovoltaic systems on the roof. While the Competence Center
  will be built and operated by Encory GmbH, the intellectual property
  for the recycling method is fully owned by the BMW Group. As a joint
  venture between the BMW Group and the Interzero Group, Encory will
  develop and implement logistics and consulting solutions, including
  for recovery, recycling and reconditioning of vehicle components. Both
  partners hold a 50-percent stake in the company. The new Competence
  Center will employ about 20 people.

With the exception of one Swiss company, only German firms were
  contracted for the construction and operation of the Competence
  Center. Nearly half of these companies are located within a
  100-kilometer radius of Salching.

The BMW Group consolidates its battery cell expertise at its
  Competence Centers in Munich, Parsdorf and Salching. The Battery Cell
  Competence Center (BCCC) in the north of Munich offers
  state-of-the-art labs and research facilities for developing the
  battery cells for next-generation high-voltage batteries and producing
  them in small quantities. The best battery cell from the BCCC will be
  scaled up for series processes on a pilot line at the Cell
  Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) in Parsdorf. Recycling of
  surplus material from pilot production in Parsdorf will take place at
  the new Cell Recycling Competence Center (CRCC) in Salching. The
  recovered raw materials will then be reused in cell production,
  ensuring short distances between all Competence Centers and preventing
  valuable raw materials from being lost. Following on from the BCCC and
  CMCC, the CRCC thus represents the next step in the BMW Group’s
  battery cell strategy on the road to the circular economy.

The BMW Group views the circular economy as one of the key issues in
  shaping more resource-efficient mobility. Its approach is aimed at
  finding the best ways to keep materials in the cycle – ensuring that
  resources are not lost, but retain their value for long-term use. The
  BMW Group applies the principles of Re:Think, Re:Duce, Re:Use and
  Re:Cycle. From vehicle design and production, to recycling and reuse,
  everything is geared towards ensuring that vehicles can serve as a
  source of raw vehicles at the end of their use phase. The BMW Group is
  taking steps to increase the percentage of recycled materials. It
  returns selected production residues to the material supplier or
  material processor, enabling their recovery and reintroduction into a
  new manufacturing process. In this way, recycled and reused materials
  are already making their way into BMW Group vehicles today. The
  circular economy requires holistic thinking – from product design, all
  the way through to vehicle recycling.
