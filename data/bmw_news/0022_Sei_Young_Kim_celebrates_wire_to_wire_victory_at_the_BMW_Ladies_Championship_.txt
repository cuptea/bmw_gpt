+++ Sei Young Kim from South Korea secures home victory at the BMW
  Ladies Championship +++ First title for the 32-year-old major champion
  in five years +++ Lucy Li (USA) wins all-electric BMW i7 eDrive50 with
  a hole-in-one +++ 66,000 fans attend tournament week at Pine Beach
  Golf Links +++

It was a final to delight the 30,000 spectators who
  came to Pine Beach Golf Links on Sunday as local hero Sei Young Kim
  (264 strokes, -24) won the BMW Ladies Championship 2025 convincingly
  with a four-stroke lead over Japan’s Nasa Hataoka. This marked the
  first victory by a South Korean player at the only LPGA Tour event in
  South Korea since Jin Young Ko’s triumph in 2021. Kim started the
  tournament with an impressive opening round (62 strokes, -10) and
  never looked back.

For the 32-year-old, this was her 13th title on the LPGA Tour and her
  first since winning the Women’s PGA Championship in 2020. Behind Kim
  and Hataoka, Celine Boutier from France and South Korea’s A Lim Kim
  (both -18) shared third place, while defending champion Hannah Green
  (AUS) and Yealimi Noh (USA, both -17) tied for fifth.

A highlight of the BMW Ladies Championship, which was attended by a
  total of 66,000 golf fans, came in the first round when Lucy Li scored
  a hole-in-one on the 13th hole (Par 3). For the spectacular shot from
  a distance of 155 yards using a 7-iron, the American was rewarded with
  an all-electric BMW i7 eDrive50. Li is the fourth player to earn a
  Hole-in-One Award at the BMW Ladies Championship, following Kristen
  Gillman (USA, 2019), Na Yeon Choi (KOR, 2022), and Ariya Jutanugarn
  (THA, 2022).

Next year, the BMW Ladies Championship will once again be held at
  Pine Beach Golf Links near Gwangju in the southwest of the country. To
  showcase the world-class golfers to fans nationwide, the tournament,
  organised by BMW Korea since 2019, regularly changes its venue.
