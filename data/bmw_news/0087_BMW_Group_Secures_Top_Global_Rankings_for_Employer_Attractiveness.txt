A clear strategy, fascinating products and
  competent leadership are decisive factors for the attractiveness of
  employers today. Especially in times of global and economic
  uncertainty, the BMW Group proves to be a reliable partner for its
  employees. Numerous recent studies confirm this and have once again
  recognised the BMW Group as one of the most attractive employers in 2025.

In the Trendence Professionals Barometer 2025, the BMW Group achieved
  first place for the 14th time in a row. This study is one of the
  leading surveys on employer attractiveness and is based on a survey of
  around 18,000 academics in Germany. The BMW Group also once again
  achieved top positions in other renowned rankings such as Universum's
  "Most Attractive Employers in Europe" and the international
  Forbes ranking "World's Best Employers".

"You don't become the best employer by yourself. For us, it's
  about more than awards: We are facing one of the biggest changes in
  our industry - electromobility, digitalisation and artificial
  intelligence. Anyone who chooses the BMW Group relies on responsible
  behaviour, a clear strategy and the courage to try something new. This
  is exactly what makes us strong. We are looking for people who not
  only want to manage, but also to shape - people who are ready to make
  the future of individual mobility electric, digital and circular with
  us," emphasises Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of
  Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate, Labour Director.

The BMW Group offers its employees not only premium products, but
  also exciting fields of work in future topics such as artificial
  intelligence, electromobility and digitalisation. This is complemented
  by above-average remuneration, extensive additional benefits, mobility
  and health offers as well as a wide range of opportunities for
  personal and professional development.

The BMW Group is also one of the top employers internationally. In
  the current ranking of the "Most Attractive Employers in Europe
  2025" by study provider Universum, in which over 64,000 students
  from six major European economic nations took part, the BMW Group
  ranks seventh worldwide among prospective engineers. Among students in
  the fields of IT and business, the company ranks among the top 18
  employers worldwide. In addition, the BMW Group was honoured with
  fifth place in the global Forbes survey "World's Best Employers
  2025", which is based on the responses of 300,000 professionals
  from 50 countries. This makes the BMW Group not only the best
  automotive player in this international ranking, but also the
  best-placed German and European company.

The BMW Group also achieved outstanding results in other national studies:

The external perception is in line with the results of the internal
  employee survey: 92 per cent of BMW Group employees are proud to be
  part of the company and 87 per cent would recommend the BMW Group as
  an employer.

These top figures once again confirm the results of the employee
  surveys of previous years and also emphasise the attractiveness of the
  BMW Group as an employer.

Young talents and experienced professionals in future competences
  such as artificial intelligence, software development and data science
  will find exciting challenges at the BMW Group and can apply at any
  time. Interested talents can find out what working at the BMW Group is
