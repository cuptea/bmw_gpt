After Friday’s qualifying session came the 12-lap qualification race
  on Saturday, followed by the 16-lap main race on Sunday. Marciello
  secured fifth place in qualifying. Van der Linde was unlucky as after
  making contact with the track barrier he was unable to set a timed lap
  and had to start the qualification race from the back of the grid. In
  Saturday’s sprint race, which determined the starting positions for
  Sunday, both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs moved forward. Marciello finished fourth,
  while van der Linde improved to 13th and was then promoted to 12th
  after a competitor received a penalty.

In the main race, Marciello seized his chance immediately at the
  start and sprinted up to second place – a podium position he held
  until the finish line. Van der Linde gained several positions in the
  turbulent opening stage and later executed a brilliant overtaking
  manoeuvre on the tight street circuit to take sixth place. The winner
  of the main race was Antonio Fuoco (ITA / Ferrari), who had already
  taken pole position and won the qualification race.

“The second
  place in Macau this year was a great performance by Raffaele. Gaining
  positions right at the start was the key to the podium after starting
  from fourth. Congratulations to Ferrari; I think we were simply
  missing the pace to keep up with Antonio Fuoco. Given that, we are
  happy with second place. For Sheldon, it was unfortunate that he
  couldn’t set a time in Friday’s qualifying. We all know that
  qualifying is crucial here on this narrow street circuit in Macau.
  Nevertheless, he gave a great performance and worked his way from the
  very back to sixth place in the main race over the course of the
  weekend. Many thanks to ROWE Racing, to Team WRT, and to everyone at
  BMW M Motorsport. Now we wrap up the season and focus fully on the new year.”

“Our qualifying was not the best, for sure. When
  you start from fifth it’s always difficult to fight your way to the
  front. But we had a good first sector and in the main race, there was
  the opportunity to overtake at the start. But in the end we also need
  to admit that the Ferrari was too quick. I tried my best and second
  place was the maximum I could do today.”

“Unfortunately it has not been the weekend we came
  here for. We obviously wanted to try to win the race, that was my main
  goal coming into the weekend. But it started off on the wrong foot in
  qualifying with a mistake that I take responsibility for. We had to
  start at the back of the field in the qualifying race, had a very good
  start but then unfortunately got spun around in turn three. So that
  was another rollercoaster we had to go through. But in the main race,
  we gained a lot of places at the start and I was able to capitalise on
  others making mistakes. So, yes, we are happy with the end, even if it
  didn’t start how we wanted it to. But from P16 to P6: we would have
  signed that before the race.”
