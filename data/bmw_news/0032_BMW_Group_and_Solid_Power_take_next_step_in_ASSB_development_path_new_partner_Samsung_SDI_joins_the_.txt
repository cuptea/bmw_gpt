Since 2022, the BMW Group and Solid Power,
  Inc. (Nasdaq: SLDP) have intensified their activities for the
  development of all-solid-state battery (ASSB) technology through their
  technology transfer agreement. The latest milestone was the
  integration of Solid Power’s large-format pure ASSB cells into a BMW
  i7 technology test vehicle.

As of October 2025, Samsung SDI joins the efforts to
  pursue development and validation of the ASSB technology in the
  automotive field. The new collaboration marks a key step towards ASSB
  technology, bringing together the complementary expertise of three
  industry leaders.

Under this arrangement, Solid Power will supply sulfide-based
  solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI, which Samsung SDI will integrate
  into separator and/or catholyte and use to build cells, in each case
  subject to achievement of technical requirements.

These cells
  will be evaluated based on performance parameters and requirements to
  be agreed between Samsung SDI and BMW Group. Ultimately, Solid Power,
  Samsung SDI, and BMW aim to develop and supply ASSB cells for
  integration into a next generation of evaluation vehicles.

“We are excited to partner with Samsung SDI and BMW
  to progress the development of all-solid-state batteries,” said John
  Van Scoter, President and CEO of Solid Power. “Our solid electrolyte
  technology is designed for stability and conductivity, and by working
  closely with global leaders in automotive and battery innovation, we
  strive to bring ASSB technology closer to widespread adoption.”

"Technological competitiveness in batteries would ultimately
  lead to innovation in electric vehicles," said Stella Joo-Young
  Go, Executive Vice President of ASSB Commercialization Team at Samsung
  SDI. "Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners
  like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercializing ASSB."

Martin Schuster, Vice President Battery Cell
  and Cell Module at the BMW Group, says: “With Samsung SDI joining our
  partnership with Solid Power, we gain significant momentum on our path
  advancing the development of new battery cell technologies. This
  global collaboration is another proof point of our overarching goal:
  to be always in a position to offer our customers state of the art
  battery technology.”

The partners believe in the potential of genuine ASSB
  technology, and the promise of higher energy density combined with
  increased safety compared to today’s technologies by replacing liquid
  electrolytes with solid materials.

With increased energy density, longer vehicle ranges can be
  achieved without having to accept disadvantages in terms of weight of
  the overall storage system.

The BMW Group and Solid Power have been cooperating since 2016
  through an extended “Joint Development Agreement,” which was supported
  by a BMW Group investment in Solid Power in May 2021 as part of a
  financing round.

At the end of 2022, BMW and Solid Power agreed to
  further deepen their partnership. BMW will operate a solid-state cell
  prototype line at the CMCC in Parsdorf, on the basis of a research and
  development license and with Solid Power's experience and expertise.

Since 2008, the BMW Group has been consistently
  building up its competence in the field of battery cell technology.
  Since 2019, this know-how has been pooled at the BMW Group's Battery
  Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in Munich. The BCCC covers the entire
  value chain, from research and development to battery cell design to producibility.

In order to be able to quickly and efficiently
  implement innovations in the field of battery cell technology, the BMW
  Group cooperates in a network of around 300 partners, including
  established companies, start-ups and universities, among others.

The BMW Group's battery strategy - to operate on
  equal footing with industry's leading cell manufacturers through deep
  know-how - has proven its worth. This strategically strong position in
  the value chain ensures the BMW Group access to all new and innovative
  battery cell research solutions worldwide.
