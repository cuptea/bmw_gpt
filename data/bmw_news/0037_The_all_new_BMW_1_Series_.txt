The pioneer of driving pleasure in the premium compact segment is
  entering its fourth model generation. With a dynamic design presence,
  a completely revised drive portfolio and extensively improved chassis
  technology, the new BMW 1 Series has sharpened its profile as the
  sportiest vehicle in the competitive environment. Highly efficient
  engines with 48-volt mild hybrid technology and a production process
  designed to conserve resources and recycle materials optimise
  sustainability throughout the entire product life cycle. Its
  progressive character is also reflected in the redesigned interior, an
  extended range of automated driving and parking systems, the new BMW
  iDrive with QuickSelect and innovative digital services based on BMW
  Operating System 9.

The premiere of the new BMW 1 Series marks the start of a new chapter
  in the brand's 20-year success story in the compact segment. The new
  model generation will also be produced at the BMW Group plant in
  Leipzig. Its market launch is scheduled for October 2024. The most
  important sales region is the German domestic market. In addition to
  other European countries, Japan is one of the top five markets for the
  new BMW 1 Series.

The sporty aura of the BMW 1 Series is underlined in the latest model
  generation by typical BMW proportions: a long bonnet, a passenger cell
  set well back, a dynamically flowing roofline and a powerful rear end.
  The dimensions of the five-door model have changed only slightly
  compared to its predecessor. The exterior length of the new
  BMW 1 Series has increased by 42 millimetres to 4,361 millimetres,
  while the wheelbase is 2,670 millimetres. The vehicle width is 1,800
  millimetres, while the height has increased by 25 millimetres to 1,459 millimetres.

With a strikingly flat front end that sits significantly lower to the
  road than its predecessor, the new BMW 1 Series signals its sporty
  character more than ever. The wide, forward-leaning BMW radiator
  grille features an innovative structure of vertical and diagonal bars.
  The standard LED headlights feature striking vertical elements for the
  daytime running light and the turn indicators. Adaptive LED headlights
  with glare-free matrix high beam, cornering light function and blue
  accents are optionally available.

The side view of the new BMW 1 Series is characterised by the dynamic
  wedge shape and the flat window graphics that taper towards the rear.
  The standard BMW Individual high-gloss Shadow Line includes a graphic
  element with the number 1 in the Hofmeister kink counter-swing on the
  C-pillar. A long roof spoiler and side air deflectors emphasise the
  stretched silhouette. Vertical reflectors and a black diffuser-style
  insert add to the powerful appearance of the rear apron. The striking,
  two-part rear lights extend will into the side sections.

The body paintwork of the new BMW 1 Series is available in two solid
  paintwork finishes and seven metallic finishes. Four BMW Individual
  paint finishes and a wide range of BMW Individual special paint
  finishes are also available. The new BMW 1 Series is the first model
  in the brand's range to be available with an optional contrasting roof
  paint finish. The high-gloss black finish adds to the sporty
  appearance of the car.

The optional M Sport Package and the M Sport Design optional
  equipment available at market launch in Europe make the new
  BMW 1 Series even more dynamic. Its M specific design features include
  large air intakes on the front apron, pronounced side skirts and a
  three-dimensional diffuser element in the rear apron.

At the top of the model range is the BMW M135 xDrive (combined fuel
  consumption: 8.1 - 7.6 l/100 km (62 miles); CO

emissions
  combined: 184 - 173 g/km according to WLTP; CO

classes: G
  - F) with significantly enhanced performance characteristics. The BMW
  M model is powered by a 221 kW/300 hp four-cylinder engine, features
  an Adaptive M Chassis with sport steering and intelligent all-wheel
  drive as standard and accelerates from zero to 100 km/h (62 mph) in
  4.9 seconds. On the outside, the M radiator grille with horizontal
  bars, M exterior mirror caps and four exhaust tailpipes make it
  instantly recognisable as a top-of-the-range model. An M Technology
  Package with specific suspension components, stiffness and lightweight
  measures, an M Compound brake system and 19-inch forged light-alloy
  wheels is available exclusively for the BMW M135 xDrive. An M Sport
  Package Pro and model-specific BMW M Performance Parts are also
  available for all variants of the new BMW 1 Series.

The newly designed interior of the new BMW 1 Series, which is
  completely leather-free as standard, offers a modern premium ambience
  with sporty accents and generous space for up to five occupants. Newly
  designed seats offer a high level of comfort for long journeys. Sport
  seats in the Econeer version with covers and upholstery made from
  recycled polyester and M sport seats are optionally available.
  Perforated seat surfaces are also available in the Veganza version
  with leather-like properties. The Veganza/Alcantara equipment is part
  of the M Sport Package and standard equipment in the BMW M135 xDrive.

Heated seats and a wide range of electric adjustments, including
  memory on the driver's side, are available as options for all seat
  versions. Lumbar support can be added to the sport seats and the
  M sport seats. An optional massage function is also available for the
  sport seats. A driver and front passenger interaction airbag is now
  fitted as standard to further enhance occupant protection. By folding
  down the rear seat backrests, the storage space under the tailgate can
  be increased from 380 litres to 1,200 litres (BMW 120, BMW 120d: 300 -
  1,135 litres).

High-quality surfaces and trim, the redesigned gear selector and the
  BMW Curved Display underline the progressive, premium ambience of the
  interior. The fully digital display system comprises a 10.25-inch
  Information Display and a 10.7-inch Control Display. The number of
  buttons and controls in the cockpit has been significantly reduced
  thanks to the consistent use of digital technology. The air
  conditioning in the new BMW 1 Series is also controlled digitally. As
  an alternative to the standard sport steering wheel, a similarly
  redesigned M leather steering wheel is also available. It is part of
  the M Sport Package and has shift paddles for manual gear changes.

Like the BMW M135 xDrive engine, all of the other engines available
  for the new BMW 1 Series are part of the latest generation of modular
  engines from the BMW Group. The three-cylinder petrol engine of the
  new BMW 120 (combined fuel consumption: 6.0 - 5.3 l/100 km (62 miles);
  CO

emissions combined: 135 - 121 g/km according to WLTP;
  CO

classes: D) and the four-cylinder diesel engine of the
  new BMW 120d (combined fuel consumption: 4.8 - 4.3 l/100 km (62
  miles); CO

emissions combined: 125 - 112 g/km according to
  WLTP; CO

classes: D - C) are combined with 48-volt mild
  hybrid technology, which enhances both their efficiency and their
  spontaneous power delivery. All of the drive units transmit their
  power to a 7-speed Steptronic transmission with dual clutch as standard.

With a maximum power output of 125 kW/170 hp, the drive system of the
  new BMW 120 accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 7.8 seconds.
  The new BMW 120d generates a power output of 120 kW/163 hp and
  accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 7.9 seconds. The BMW 118d,
  also powered by a four-cylinder diesel engine (combined fuel
  consumption: 5.2 - 4.6 l/100 km (62 miles);

emissions combined: 136 - 122 g/km according to WLTP; CO

classes: E - D) delivers 110 kW/150 hp and an acceleration of 8.3 seconds.

The agility, steering precision and cornering dynamics of the new
  BMW 1 Series benefit from the increased rigidity of the body structure
  and the chassis connection. Advanced chassis technology includes
  optimised kinematics, highly preloaded anti-roll bar mounts and new
  shock absorber technology. The caster of the front wheels has been
  increased by 20 per cent, ensuring particularly stable directional
  stability and optimised steering feedback.

In addition to the directly controlled wheel slip limitation, the new
  BMW 1 Series also features an integrated braking system and 17-inch
  light-alloy wheels (BMW M135 xDrive: 18-inch) as standard. The
  optional M Sport Package includes the Adaptive M Chassis, which lowers
  the vehicle by up to 8 millimetres, sport steering and 18-inch
  light-alloy wheels. Up to 19-inch light-alloy wheels and an M sport
  brake system are also available as optional equipment.

The new BMW 1 Series offers a significantly extended range of
  automated driving and parking systems as standard or optional
  equipment. Standard features include the Driving Assistant with front
  collision warning, Lane Departure Warning, Exit Warning and Traffic
  Sign Recognition, as well as the Parking Assistant with Reversing Assistant.

Highlights of the optional range include Steering and Lane Control
  Assist, Automatic Speed Limit Assist and route guidance when using
  Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function. Parking Assistant
  Professional is also available for the new BMW 120 and the new
  BMW 120d, allowing parking and manoeuvring to be controlled by smartphone.

In addition to the high-quality assistance systems, the significantly
  expanded range of standard equipment of the new BMW 1 Series also
  includes automatic air conditioning, electrically folding exterior
  mirrors and the BMW Live Cockpit Plus including the BMW Maps
  cloud-based navigation system. New optional equipment packages allow
  targeted individualisation.

The Innovation Package includes BMW Live Cockpit Professional with
  BMW Head-Up Display and Augmented View on the Control Display as well
  as Parking Assistant Plus. The Premium Package includes the telephone
  option with wireless charging, Comfort Access, logo projection from
  the exterior mirrors, automatic dimming interior mirror and adaptive
  LED headlights. The range of optional equipment also includes 2-zone
  automatic air conditioning, a panoramic glass roof and a Harman Kardon
  sound system.

The new BMW 1 Series features the latest version of BMW iDrive with
  QuickSelect for intuitive and convenient operation of the vehicle's
  functions. The new home screen shows function icons vertically
  arranged on the same level. "QuickSelect" allows direct
  access to functions without having to switch to a submenu. The new BMW
  iDrive is consistently designed for touch operation and voice control.
  It is based on the BMW Operating System 9, which also provides the
  basis for a highly individual selection of additional digital
  services. Remote software upgrades allow new and improved vehicle
  functions to be integrated into the vehicle over-the-air. With BMW
  ConnectedDrive Upgrades, customers can also test selected functions
  free of charge for a period of one month and then book them for a
  specific period. The new BMW Digital Premium offer can also be booked
  for the new BMW 1 Series in the BMW ConnectedDrive Store.

BMW Digital Premium makes it possible to use country-specific apps,
  such as music and video streaming, news or gaming, in the vehicle as
  part of a subscription. The offer also includes data usage for all
  digital services and the apps contained in the BMW ConnectedDrive
  Store. BMW Digital Premium also extends the functions of the BMW Maps
  navigation system and the selection of My Modes and the lighting for
  the welcome and goodbye animation. In selected countries, BMW Digital
  Premium also enables digital payment of parking fees and fuel bills
  from the vehicle.

Smartphone integration with Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ is
  available as standard in the new BMW 1 Series. BMW ID and My BMW App
  offer a convenient way to personalise the user experience in the new
  BMW 1 Series. The BMW Digital Key Plus with ultra-wideband wireless
  technology for compatible smartphones with iOS or Android operating
  systems and the Apple Watch can also be optionally set up via the My
  BMW App.
