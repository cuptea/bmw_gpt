With the festive season just around the
  corner, the MINI Aceman SE (WLTP combined: Energy consumption 14.7 -
  14.0 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions 0 g/km; CO2 class: A), is the perfect
  companion for driving through wintry landscapes in a stylish and safe
  manner. Its powerful front-wheel drive powertrain producing 218 hp
  (164 kW) whilst accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h in just 7.1 seconds
  makes the MINI Aceman the perfect driving partner in all scenarios.
  The latest assistance systems ensure additional safety measures,
  especially in the darker months of the year, these functions increase
  overall driver safety and ensure that the whole family arrives at
  their destination relaxed and safe.

The Indigo Sunset Blue exterior paint colour available on the MINI
  Aceman in combination with the Favoured Trim is reminiscent of a clear
  night sky, which is particularly atmospheric during winter months. In
  contrast, the bright Rebel Red exterior colour stands out impressively
  against the snowy surroundings. The combined 18-inch JCW Rallye Spoke
  alloy wheels not only set sporty accents but also master winter road
  conditions with ease - for safe and stylish driving in wintry weather conditions.

The generous luggage compartment volume of 300 to 1,005 litres in the
  MINI Aceman offers sufficient space for luggage and seasonal gifts.
  The trolleys from the MINI Lifestyle Collection - the MINI Debossed
  Wing Logo Trolley (RRP: €229.99) and the MINI Debossed Wing Logo Cabin
  Trolley (RRP: €229.99) - not only have ample space, but they are also
  available in three colour variants based on MINI exterior paintwork:
  Rebel Red, Blazing Blue and Black.

The cuddly MINI Bulldog 2.0 (RRP: €28.00) and the MINI Aluminium
  Balance Bike (RRP: €229.99) from the MINI Lifestyle Collection are the
  perfect gifts for the younger members of the family. They not only
  bring joy under the Christmas tree but also accompany the little ones
  on their first MINI adventures. The MINI Colour Block travel mug,
  which is available in 300 ml (RRP: €25.00) and 500 ml (RRP: €29.00),
  ensures the right temperature for cold or hot drinks on the journey.
