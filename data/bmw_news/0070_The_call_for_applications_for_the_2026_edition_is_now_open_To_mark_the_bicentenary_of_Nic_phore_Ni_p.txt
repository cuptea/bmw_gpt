  exceptional edition encourages the exploration of the links between
  image, innovation and transformation, in a context where creativity
  and responsibility come together.

Since 1826, photography has stood at the heart of cultural and
  technological change—an ambition now shared by BMW through its

For more
  than 50 years, BMW has been committed to culture, convinced that
  artists are pioneers capable of anticipating and revealing the major
  challenges of their time. Supporting creativity means supporting those
  who are shaping the future.

This commitment is exemplified in its longstanding partnerships—23
  years with Paris Photo and 15 years with the Rencontres
  Photographiques d’Arles. By supporting the international art scene,
  BMW offers decisive visibility to emerging talents, many of whom have
  since achieved major recognition, reaffirming the relevance of this
  engagement. This dialogue between artistic innovation, society and
  business reflects a shared ambition: to safeguard the future of
  culture and make it accessible to all, today and for generations to come.

From Frank Stella to Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons and the emerging artists
  of the BMW Residency and the BMW ART MAKERS programme, BMW has spent
  decades promoting new artistic perspectives and the hybridisation of
  techniques across contemporary art, music, architecture, design,
  photography and the visual arts. Hundreds of projects have been
  created worldwide.
