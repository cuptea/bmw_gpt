The new features set to enhance the BMW model
  line-up from autumn 2023 centre on the latest advances in terms of
  digitalisation. The new BMW X1 and BMW 2 Series Active Tourer will
  both be equipped with the upgraded BMW iDrive featuring QuickSelect
  and BMW Operating System 9 from November 2023. The BMW Digital Premium
  offering, with its highly customisable selection of online-based
  services, is also being introduced in both model series at the same
  time. Plus, extra digital services will be made available for a large
  number of current models via Remote Software Upgrade. Meanwhile, an
  extended range of functions will also add to the appeal of the My BMW App.

When it comes to automated driving systems, the highlight is without
  doubt the new Highway Assistant, which is also due to become available
  for models in the BMW 7 Series range from March 2024 following its
  premiere in the new 5 Series Sedan. Autumn 2023 will also bring
  additions to the choice of exterior colours and light-alloy wheels for
  selected models.

From November 2023, the upgraded BMW iDrive with QuickSelect will be
  fitted as standard in all model variants of the new BMW X1, the
  all-electric BMW iX1 and the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, enabling
  numerous vehicle functions to be operated even more intuitively and
  easily. The latest incarnation of the display and control/operation
  system is based on BMW Operating System 9 and is packaged together
  with the BMW Curved Display and BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.

The new BMW iDrive features a redesigned home screen and the
  QuickSelect rapid-access tech, bringing an improved menu structure
  that takes its cue from consumer electronics devices. The new home
  screen displays the navigation system’s map view or other individually
  configurable graphics in the control display at all times. On the same
  level, function icons appear in a vertical arrangement on the driver’s
  side of the display. Drivers can switch between icons with a vertical
  swipe of the finger. The QuickSelect feature allows the function
  selected in this way to be activated directly without having to enter
  a submenu.

BMW Operating System 9 was developed in-house by the BMW Group and is
  based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack for the
  first time. It provides the basis for a broader offering of digital
  content that serves information and entertainment, shorter function
  update cycles and improved accessibility to a host of specific online services.

The new BMW Digital Premium offering will be brought out in Germany
  in November 2023 alongside the introduction of BMW Operating System 9.
  It will be available as an option for BMW X1, BMW iX1 and BMW 2 Series
  Active Tourer models and can be ordered from the BMW ConnectedDrive
  Store, which has now been expanded with the addition of further
  third-party apps. This means customers can enjoy in-car use of all the
  apps available in their country, e.g. for video and music streaming,
  news or gaming, as part of a package. In addition to this, BMW Digital
  Premium also includes enhanced navigation functions along with added
  customisation options thanks to extra My Modes, for instance.

As with all other ConnectedDrive Upgrades, BMW Digital Premium can be
  obtained from the ConnectedDrive Store either on the website, in the
  My BMW App or directly in the car. And, from November 2023, it will be
  even easier for customers to add ConnectedDrive Upgrades, as it will
  then be possible to not just select them directly from their vehicle,
  but to pay for them at the same time. In other words, instead of being
  redirected to the app or internet to complete their order, customers
  will be able to carry out the entire process, including payment, from
  the comfort of their car.

This new offering is designed to allow customers to put together a
  customised selection of digital services from the growing variety on
  offer – one that is perfectly suited to their personal requirements.
  BMW Digital Premium is available in Germany, for example, for €9.98 a
  month or from mid-2024 (provisionally) for an annual fee of €99 (both
  including VAT). The package also covers data usage for all digital
  services and the apps available from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store,
  including music and video streaming. Customers can take advantage of a
  free three-month trial period that will allow them to sample all the
  BMW Digital Premium services and content.

A new form of in-car gaming unique in the automotive sector is one of
  the highlights of BMW Digital Premium. BMW is presenting a wide
  selection of casual games that use a smartphone as the controller in
  collaboration with the AirConsole gaming platform. The games can be
  played in either solo or multiplayer mode when the vehicle is
  stationary as a way of passing the time while e.g. waiting for the
  high-voltage battery in the BMW iX1 or the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer
  plug-in hybrid models to recharge. About ten titles will initially be
  available to play, including racing, sport, quiz and skill games, and
  the range will continue to grow.

Besides audio streaming, BMW Digital Premium also lets the occupants
  enjoy a wide variety of video streaming services (powered by Xperi
  TiVo) on the control display while the car is stationary. This offers
  customers access to an ever-growing selection of aggregated video
  content, such as news and live or on-demand streaming of movies and
  series, for instance, along with country-specific content. Available
  with BMW Digital Premium in the USA, UK, South Korea, France, Italy,
  Germany and Spain, the Video App will feature, among other things, the
  Pluto, Bloomberg Television, Deutsche Welle, Al Jazeera and TED
  portals. In Germany, the package will additionally include the
  tagesschau news service app as well as the popular streaming service
  JOYN. Country-specific content will also be offered from the outset in
  Italy and the USA. The portfolio of video streaming platforms will
  keep evolving and will be gradually rolled out to other countries too.

One of the key benefits of BMW Digital Premium is the enhanced
  functionality of the cloud-based navigation system BMW Maps. For
  example, real-time traffic information (RTTI) with colour coding shows
  how freely traffic is flowing across the entire map area, even if
  route guidance is not activated. Other functions include 3D
  visualisation of buildings and surrounding elements in the map view
  and extended information on parking facilities. The driver is also
  proactively notified of the current traffic situation and estimated
  time of arrival when setting out to destinations they drive to
  regularly. If necessary, the system will even propose an alternative
  route. Turn-off instructions and lane recommendations are shown in
  realistic form in both the information display and the optional BMW
  Head-Up Display.

In Germany and other European countries, BMW Digital Premium offers
  the additional benefit of allowing drivers to pay parking fees
  directly from their vehicle in parking zones that support this payment
  method. And drivers in Germany also have the option of settling fuel
  bills digitally from their car after refuelling at participating
  filling stations. In both cases, payment is made using a credit card
  that is first registered with the partner company Parkopedia via the
  My BMW App.

In addition, BMW Digital Premium adds Expressive Mode, Relax Mode and
  Digital Art Mode to the choice of My Modes, opening up still greater
  scope for customising the driving experience. And it also brings new
  variants for both the Welcome Light sequence and the graphics
  visualising the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.

The Remote Software Upgrades bring existing digital functions right
  up to date. At the same time, new features and improvements to quality
  can also be imported into the car over the air. The latest in-car
  gaming and video-streaming services for BMW models will be made
  available in this way for the majority of vehicles with BMW Operating
  System 8.5 in autumn 2023.

Customers also receive notification of the Remote Software Upgrades
  in the My BMW App. Another option is for upgrades to be downloaded via
  the My BMW App and transferred to the vehicle before initiating the
  installation process there.

The My BMW App for smartphones provides customers with a direct link
  to their car and, depending on the vehicle configuration and country,
  offers them the benefit of numerous functions designed to make
  day-to-day mobility even more straightforward. This includes
  information transferred to the user’s smartphone on their vehicle’s
  status, servicing requirements, charging status and range, as well as
  remote access to functions for vehicle locating, locking and unlocking
  the doors, climate control and monitoring the car’s immediate
  vicinity. Charging-optimised routes can also be planned via the My BMW
  App and destination addresses sent from a smartphone to the vehicle’s
  navigation system. From autumn 2023, it will also be possible to enter
  mid-journey stops as part of the process.

And from March 2024, customers with compatible Android smartphones
  will also be able to use the My BMW App to operate the Remote Control
  Parking and Manoeuvre Assistant functions available with the optional
  Parking Assistant Professional and BMW Digital Key Plus. The My BMW
  App will also indicate the status of the alarm system on suitably
  equipped vehicles and show how it can be fully or partially activated.

BMW has become the first carmaker to gain approval from Germany’s
  Federal Motor Transport Authority for semi-automated driving at speeds
  up to 130 km/h (81 mph). As a result, the BMW Highway Assistant
  already available in the USA and Canada is now set to become an
  extremely innovative component of the optional Driving Assistant
  Professional package in Germany too. The new function lets the driver
  take their hands off the steering wheel and put them in a comfortable
  position while driving. First launched in the new BMW 5 Series Sedan,
  it will also become available to use in the BMW 7 Series luxury sedan
  from spring 2024.

The BMW Highway Assistant can operate on multi-lane roads with
  structurally separated carriageways, with the function’s availability
  indicated to the driver in the information display. On suitably
  designated stretches of road, the driver is able to take their hands
  off the steering wheel for longer periods and position them
  comfortably, provided they continue to pay attention to what is
  happening on the road and are able to take over the steering again at
  any time. The Active Lane Change Assistant with eye confirmation
  included as part of the new BMW Highway Assistant adds another layer
  to the automated driving experience. As soon as the traffic situation
  permits, it is capable of performing the necessary steering movements
  for an overtaking manoeuvre, for example, and adjusting the vehicle’s
  speed as required. Plus, for the first time, the driver is able to
  initiate a lane change suggested by this system by simply looking in
  the exterior mirror to confirm it.

A new shade is already being added to the selection of exterior
  colours for the new BMW 5 Series Sedan, just a short time after its
  launch. The Fire Red metallic paint finish will be made available for
  the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan (electric power consumption combined:
  20.6 – 18.2 kWh/100 km in the WLTP cycle) from November 2023, as well
  as for all other model variants of the new business sedan specified
  with the M Sport package.

A further highly exclusive design of light-alloy wheel will be added
  to the range of optional extras for the BMW 7 Series from November
  2023. At the same time, 21-inch BMW Individual light-alloy wheels in
  multi-spoke design will also be available for all model variants of
  the luxury sedan. They have a bi-colour finish and are fitted with
  mixed-size tyres.

All of the stated model variants, equipment features, technical data
  and fuel/electric power consumption and emissions figures relate to
  the offering in the German market.
