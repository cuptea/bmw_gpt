BMW Motorrad posted another strong result in
  2025: for the fourth consecutive year the company delivered more than
  200,000 motorcycles to customers — a total of 202,563 units worldwide.
  This performance underscores the sustained appeal of our model range
  and the operational strength of BMW Motorrad.

Despite a challenging market environment — including a global
  decline in the over‑500 cc segment, volatile conditions, intense price
  competition, regulatory constraints and new customs rules — BMW
  Motorrad achieved a solid sales result. Particularly encouraging:
  several markets recorded their best results ever, including Italy,
  Spain, Japan, Australia, Portugal, Canada, Malaysia and the
  Netherlands.

In December, a total of 15,109 motorcycles were sold
  — the third‑best December in

BMW Motorrad’s history and an
  impressive year‑end driver.

“In a demanding market environment we played to our strengths
  and performed better than ever in many markets and segments. In key
  markets such as Germany we were even able to gain market share (+4.1
  p.p. over 500 cc) and expand our market leadership. We owe this
  leading position to our commitment to technological leadership, a
  consistent strategic focus on brand strength and, not least, an
  attractive product offering. BMW Motorrad will continue to build on
  these success drivers, which is why I look to 2026 with great confidence.”

A total of 118,814 motorcycles were sold in
  Europe, a slight increase versus the previous year. In addition to the
  record results already mentioned for Italy, Spain, Portugal and the
  Netherlands, the Central Europe region increased its volume to 12,248
  units, another new high. Germany remains the strongest single market
  worldwide with 25,516 motorcycles sold, followed by France (19,019),
  Italy (16,692) and Spain (14,005).

Key markets outside Europe also
  demonstrated convincing sales strength in 2025 despite some
  significant restrictions. The USA (14,869), Brazil (14,488) and China
  (10,555) made substantial contributions to BMW Motorrad’s overall result.

A
  decisive success factor was the appealing model range and the launch
  of important new models: the BMW R 1300 RT, BMW R 1300 R and BMW R
  1300 RS were met with immediate customer enthusiasm. The BMW R 1300 GS
  Adventure introduced a year earlier also made a considerable
  contribution to sales. The new BMW R 12 G/S, with its legendary
  air/oil‑cooled boxer engine, exceeded expectations already in its
  launch year.

The
  highest‑volume models in the portfolio were once again the iconic
  boxer models

BMW R 1300 GS Adventure (33,570 units) and BMW R
  1300 GS (32,555), while the four‑cylinder power segment was
  represented by the BMW S 1000 RR (11,643) in third place.

The middleweight class developed very
  positively and reached 41,166 sales, an increase on the previous year,
  supported by strong contributions from the BMW F 800 GS,

BMW F
  900 R and BMW F 900 GS. Models of the G family performed solidly in
  the sub‑500 cc segment — despite the fact that the new BMW F 450 GS,
  already celebrated as a concept bike at its presentation, is due to be
  launched. The Urban Mobility segment also impressed: C 400 GT,      C
  400 X and the fully electric CE 04 and CE 02 together recorded more
  than 18,400 sales.

The appeal of performance and riding dynamics
  also drove a marked sales increase for BMW Motorrad’s sporty
  four‑cylinder models. The S‑series four‑cylinder models accounted for
  20,859 units; including the M models BMW M 1000 R, BMW M 1000 RR and
  BMW M 1000 XR, the four‑cylinder segment totals 28,408 sold motorcycles.

With a broad and successful
  product portfolio, BMW Motorrad enters 2026 with confidence. The
  objective is to further strengthen its leading position in the global
  premium motorcycle segment. Customers and fans can again look forward
  to numerous highlights, events and emotion‑filled offers around
  motorcycling this year — including the market launch of the new BMW F
  450 GS in spring and the BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy in
  autumn in Romania.
