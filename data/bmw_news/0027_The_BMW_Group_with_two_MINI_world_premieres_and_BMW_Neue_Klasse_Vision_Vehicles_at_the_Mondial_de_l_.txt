Parallel to the market launch of the new BMW 1
  Series, the new BMW X3 and the new BMW M5, the BMW Group will present
  the next steps in its unchanged product strategy at the Mondial de
  l'Auto Paris 2024. The focus is on the world premieres of the first
  all-electric MINI John Cooper Works models and the first joint motor
  show appearance of the latest concept studies of the BMW Neue Klasse,
  which will go into series production in 2025.

says Jochen Goller, member of the Board of Management
  of BMW AG, responsible for Customers, Brands, Sales.

With the world premiere of the all-electric MINI John Cooper
  Works Electric and the MINI John Cooper Works Aceman, the brand's long
  racing history is transferred to the here and now with innovative
  power. The two models effortlessly transfer motorsport expertise from
  the race track to the road. In addition to the exclusive, sporty design

The roll-out of electrification to the John Cooper Works brand within
  MINI transmits another strong signal on how the BMW Group is committed
  to electric driving as a strategic direction.

At the same time, the Mondial de l'Auto Paris 2024 marks the
  ideal starting point for intensified communication in the further ramp
  up for BMW Neue Klasse, due for launch in 2025.

BMW is showing two Neue Klasse
  Vision Vehicles in Paris, which provide an outlook on the wide range
  of BMW's future model portfolio.

The BMW Vision New Class is a
  sporty electric sedan for the premium mid-range. The BMW Vision New
  Class X transfers the philosophy and technology of the future
  generation of vehicles to the Sports Activity Vehicle segment.

, says Adrian van Hooydonk, head of BMW Group Design.

Both vehicles are characterized by a clear, reduced design
  language. In the interior, the next generation of BMW iDrive enables
  intuitive interaction between driver and vehicle. The combination of
  BMW Panoramic Vision, 3D Head-Up Display, Central Display and the new
  multifunction steering wheel redefine the BMW driver orientation.
