After 20 years of support for photography and
  10 years of the BMW Residency, BMW Group France has given a new
  direction to its artistic support in 2021 and has reinvented its
  model. Still dedicated to emerging creation, experimentation and
  image, this program opens to the visual arts and offers a grant to an
  artist-curator duo as well as a budget for research and production of works.

The artist Arash Hanaei and the curator Morad Montazami were chosen
  as the winners of the first edition with the project "Suburban
  Hauntology" which was presented at the Rencontres d'Arles and
  will be exhibited at Paris Photo from November 10 to 13.

The call for applications for the second edition is open until
  November 22, 2022:

Within the BMW Group, the relationship between man and machine,
  creativity and innovation, support and commitment are strong values.
  Support because the sponsoring company is close to the artists. It
  follows them in their creative process, respects their vision, allows
  them to dare, and gives them the material and financial means to
  realize their project. Commitment because getting involved in cultural
  patronage is a matter of course: it opens an emotional conversation
  with our society. That's how everything becomes meaningful. The human
  approach is the heart of our approach.

This freedom to create is as essential for artists as it is for BMW,
  which creates breakthrough innovations for sustainable and responsible mobility.

“Based on the observation that the world we live in is
  uncertain and that creation needs the long-term support of committed
  patrons, we have created the BMW ART MAKERS to offer an opportunity to
  emerging talents in the world of image. The program invites artists to
  take an alternative look at our environment and major societal
  challenges, through experimentation and the realization of a visual
  and multiform artistic project.” Vincent Salimon, CEO BMW Group France.

The new BMW ART MAKERS program supports projects based on the
  contemporary images, but which can explore all its dimensions and
  forms (photo, film, video, digital image, virtual), the choices and
  research of supports, reproduction techniques, and distribution networks.

Two heads are better than one. BMW ART MAKERS
  brings together and supports, within the framework of its call for
  projects, an emerging visual artist, and a curator, who must apply
  together. The strength of a duo that is both solid and complicit, this
  association is based on the trust and emulation that is essential to
  the success of a large-scale project from the first thought to the
  final work. Like the artist, the curator represents a fundamental
  element in the implementation of the artistic project as well as in
  its effective and concrete realization.

This is the first time, in France, that a program of this scope has
  allowed a curator to be supported by a grant for a project in the
  visual arts alongside an artist. The curator acts as artistic
  director, scenographer, designer, and is responsible for the
  realization of the project in the conditions of artistic requirement,
  deadline and budget described in the call for applications.

And because great ideas need to be well
  surrounded to become reality, the members of the jury who select the
  projects are also mentors during the creative process. BMW Group
  France would like to thank these undisputed figures of the art world
  for having accepted this role with enthusiasm to raise the project and
  the work to the highest level.

And because great ideas need to be financed and
  realized, BMW Group France offers:

Research and experimentation are only the starting
  point of the artistic project. Once completed, BMW Group France will
  promote the project through events with international resonance in the
  art world such as Les Rencontres d'Arles or Paris Photo.

Candidates can apply until November 22,
  2022, on the dedicated platform:

The nominated duo will be contacted in early December to present
  their project to the jury and the winning duo will be announced in
  mid-December 2022.

The work carried out within the framework of the BMW ART MAKERS
  program has resulted in the installation "Suburban
  Hauntology" which, after being presented at the Rencontres
  d'Arles this summer, will be exhibited at Paris Photo from November 10
  to 13, 2022.

This project questions the architectural utopias of the 70s, notably
  Jean Renaudie's Star building in Ivry-sur-Seine, while exploring new
  complex spaces such as the metaverse. How to rehabilitate these
  concrete ghosts in the context of reality?Combining several levels of
  reading, between still images, video and 3D design, the winning duo of
  BMW ART MAKERS, Arash Hanaei and Morad Montazami propose an immersive
  hybrid installation: digital drawings or Big Data Drawings, hologram,
  polysemic video Unblocked Avatars, and a virtual chess game between
  Mark Zuckerberg and the philosopher Mark Fischer. It is when the
  future becomes unimaginable that it becomes possible again.

From Frank Stella to Jeff
  Koons, via Andy Warhol to the emerging artists of the BMW Residency,
  the BMW Group's commitment to culture over the past 50 years is
  unquestionable. All these years have been at the service of a new
  artistic vision, of the hybridization of techniques in all its forms,
  whether in the field of contemporary art, music, architecture, design,
  or photography, of which BMW France has been a patron since 2003. A
  hundred or so projects have been created throughout the world.
