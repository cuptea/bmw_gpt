BMW Bank GmbH is
  strengthening its profile on the path to becoming a digitalized bank
  with high innovation standards: Stefan Hienzsch has been appointed as
  the new Chairman of the Board of Management with effect from 1
  December. As one of Germany's leading automotive banks, the credit
  institution is further enhancing its management board in an
  increasingly complex regulatory environment. Hienzsch, a fully
  qualified lawyer, has already been Chief Representative of BMW Bank
  since June 2024. The management board remains unchanged, with Joachim
  Herr, Torsten Matheis and Kerstin Zerbst continuing in their roles.

"Stefan Hienzsch is an experienced financial and legal
  expert who is very familiar with the challenges and opportunities of
  the BMW Group's financial services business. Under his leadership, BMW
  Bank will continue to expand its role as a reliable, innovative
  partner for our customers and dealers and continue to make a
  significant contribution to the success of the BMW Group in Germany
  and Europe," said Alexander Buresch, Chairman of the Supervisory
  Board of BMW Bank and Head of BMW Group Financial Services.

Hienzsch has more than 25 years of experience within the
  company. Previously, he headed the BMW Group's legal department for
  Corporate Finance, Financial Services and Mergers & Acquisitions
  for over a decade and held various leadership roles in the UK for the
  BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands.

"I am very pleased about the trust placed in me and look
  forward to my new role. BMW Bank will continue to systematically
  pursue its digital transformation process. My goal is to inspire
  customers and retailers with innovative, digital and sustainable
  solutions and to further develop the bank as a strong, future-oriented
  partner in the BMW Group ecosystem," says Stefan Hienzsch.
