1 January 2026 marks the launch of BMW ALPINA
  as an exclusive standalone brand under the BMW Group umbrella. The
  initial focus will be on brand activation. Key elements of the BMW
  ALPINA brand are its unique balance of maximum performance and
  superior ride comfort, combined with hallmark driving characteristics.
  This is complemented by an exclusive portfolio of bespoke options and
  custom materials along with unmistakeable details.

Given the storied history of the brand, the BMW Group is aware
  of its tremendous responsibility and committed to making the new BMW
  ALPINA chapter one that meets the highest expectations. The new
  wordmark provides a first indication. It radiates clarity, calm and
  confidence. Positioned at the centre of the rear, it underlines the
  standalone character of the new exclusive brand and its independent
  personality within the BMW Group. It is consciously inspired by the
  brand’s asymmetrical wordmark from the 1970s. The elegant,
  contemporary design provides a link between history and future.

BMW ALPINA vehicles are manufactured according to rigorous
  standards for materials selection and craftsmanship. They fulfil the
  most demanding expectations in terms of visuals, acoustics and feel.
  Moreover, buyers can choose from a remarkable portfolio of bespoke
  options. These ensure that every BMW ALPINA has its own, unmistakeable
  character. Each vehicle will be an exclusive object for connoisseurs
  in pursuit of the extraordinary, without compromises on performance,
  comfort and individuality.
