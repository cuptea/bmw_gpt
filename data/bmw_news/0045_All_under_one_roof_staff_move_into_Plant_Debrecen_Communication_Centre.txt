+++ Debrecen Plant Director Hans-Peter Kemser: “Another milestone on
  the road to the NEUE KLASSE” +++ Surrounded by all production
  technologies: Communication Centre as central hub +++ Already more
  than 1,000 employees in Debrecen +++

Employees of the future Plant Debrecen have
  moved into the central Communication Centre, where they are joining
  forces for the final stretch before the official series launch of the
  NEUE KLASSE. Debrecen Plant Director Hans-Peter Kemser is pleased with
  construction progress: “In just a few months, pre-series production
  will get underway here in Debrecen, setting new standards – not just
  for the vehicles themselves, but also for processes here at the plant.
  The Communication Centre will support us by creating short lines of
  communication and enabling a good exchange of information between all
  technologies at any time.” The architecture also supports the concept
  of the BMW iFACTORY, which will be fully implemented in Debrecen.

While non-production employees are already settling into their
  workplaces on-site, production staff are preparing for their future
  roles at Plant Debrecen within the company’s global production
  network. This will ensure a smooth start to pre-series production in
  2024 and the successful series launch of the first NEUE KLASSE model
  in 2025.

Inspired by the central building at BMW Group Plant Leipzig, the
  Communication Centre in Debrecen will also link the production
  technologies of the body shop, paint shop and assembly. In Debrecen,
  this underlying principle was further developed with the creation of a
  central building where the network idea is paramount. The open
  architecture provides both meeting spaces and sequestered workplaces.
  The two-storey Communication Centre is about 19,000 square metres in
  size; around half of this area will be office space.

The three main production areas are situated around the
  administrative area. The Communication Centre is not just where
  colleagues come together, but also people and products: From the body
  shop, which is adjacent to the office building on the right, unpainted
  car bodies will make their way on a conveyor belt, visible above
  people's heads, through the Communication Centre to the paint shop,
  located centrally behind it. From there, the painted bodies will be
  transported back through the office building to the vehicle assembly,
  which is to the left. This means that everyone who does not work
  directly in production can still see the product at all times.

The multifunctional staff restaurant can also be used for meetings
  outside of mealtimes. This is located on the ground floor as well,
  along with the central marketplace and health centre. A
  state-of-the-art laboratory also found home in the Communication
  Center's ground floor area in 1,300 square meters. The colleagues of
  the laboratory will be responsible for the premium quality of the
  colors of the Neue Klasse models. The 700-square meter, well-equipped
  Health Center of the Plant will be operating in the building as well
  to take care of the colleagues' health and well-being, while also
  carrying out prevention and screening campaigns. The upper floor is
  occupied by offices.

Digitalisation is playing a major role in construction of the plant –
  the virtual start of production for Plant Debrecen's digital twin
  already took place in March 2023. The importance of digitalisation is
  also reflected in the Communication Centre’s equipment. Meeting rooms
  feature modern digital elements that enable virtual collaboration
  throughout the plant and beyond.

The principles of the BMW iFACTORY were already taken into
  consideration during the planning phase. 5G technology is used
  throughout the grounds and paper is rarely seen at the Debrecen plant
  – which aims to be virtually paperless.

Other resources will be used carefully as well. When choosing the
  furniture, easy-to-recycle materials were preferred, with extensive
  use of wood. Plant Debrecen will also operate entirely without fossil fuels.
