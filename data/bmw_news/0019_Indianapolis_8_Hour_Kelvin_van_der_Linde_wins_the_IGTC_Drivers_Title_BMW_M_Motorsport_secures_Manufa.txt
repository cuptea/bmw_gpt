From the start of the weekend, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO showed strong pace
  on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. All five BMW cars made it into the
  Pole Shootout. Philipp Eng (AUT) set the fastest time there in the #51
  Random Vandals Racing entry – but the team was stripped of pole
  position after the car was found to be slightly under the minimum
  weight. This promoted the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Team WRT to start
  from second place, directly ahead of its sister car, the #46.

In the race, the strong performance from qualifying continued as all
  BMW M4 GT3 EVOs impressed from the start. After three and a half
  hours, the four Pro entries occupied positions two through five when
  the title contenders took over driving duties for the first time:
  Marciello in the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in second place, directly ahead
  of van der Linde in third. With two spectacular overtakes, the WRT duo
  soon took over the lead and established a 1–2 formation – before a
  thunderstorm moved over the circuit and brought out a red flag for
  more than two hours.

Around 90 minutes before the end of the clock, the Indianapolis 8
  Hour resumed behind the safety car in heavy rain. Pit stops shuffled
  the order, putting van der Linde in the lead in the #46 BMW M4 GT3
  EVO, while the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO with Marciello at the wheel lost
  two positions due to a later stop. The race was briefly restarted but
  soon ended again behind the safety car – with the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO
  leading the field to the finish. Thus, Team WRT celebrated its third
  consecutive victory at the Indianapolis 8 Hour, following wins in 2023
  and 2024.

With its fourth win in five races this season, BMW also claimed the
  IGTC Manufacturers’ Championship for the first time, while van der
  Linde secured the Drivers’ Title. Earlier in the season, BMW M
  Motorsport and van der Linde had already triumphed at the Bathurst 12
  Hour, the Nürburgring 24 Hours, and the Suzuka 1000KM. Just the
  previous Sunday, the South African and Weerts had also won the overall
  title in the GT World Challenge Europe.

Meanwhile, bad luck struck the #51 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Eng, Bill
  Auberlen, and Varun Choksey (both USA). After a brilliant opening
  stint from tenth on the grid, the Random Vandals Racing car even led
  the race at one stage. However, a technical issue with the engine cost
  the team significant time in the pits, and they eventually retired
  after the red flag. Their teammates Connor De Phillippi, Conor Daly,
  and Kenton Koch (all USA) delivered a strong performance in the #99
  BMW M4 GT3 EVO, finishing fourth overall. That result also secured De
  Phillippi and Koch the Drivers’ Title in the GT World Challenge America.

Turner Motorsport celebrated third place in the Pro-Am category with
  the #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO driven by BMW M works driver Robby Foley
  alongside Patrick Gallagher and Justin Rothberg (USA). With that
  result, Foley and Rothberg also claimed the overall Pro-Am
  Championship title.

“What an
  impressive season in the Intercontinental GT Challenge! Four wins out
  of five races underline the remarkable consistency of our teams and
  drivers. Congratulations to Team WRT for their third consecutive
  victory at the Indianapolis 8 Hour. I am absolutely delighted that we
  were able to secure the Manufacturers’ title in the series for the
  first time. Congratulations also to Kelvin van der Linde on the
  Drivers’ Championship – even though Raffaele Marciello would have
  deserved it just as much. My compliments also go to Turner Motorsport
  and Robby Foley for their Pro-Am title, as well as to Random Vandals
  Racing, Connor De Phillippi, and Kenton Koch for their GTWC America
  crown. Many thanks to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to all the
  teams who contributed to these outstanding achievements.”

“It’s a great
  way to finish the Intercontinental GT Championship with a win in
  Indianapolis – our third in a row. Unfortunately, we made a mistake
  with the #777 by not calling them in at the right time. I feel very
  sorry for Lello, but that’s racing. Still, I’m very happy that we were
  able to bring this trophy home to BMW, and of course I’m very happy
  for Kelvin. The team did a fantastic job – having two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs
  on the podium is a great result. Thanks to the SRO for this
  championship; they did an excellent job this year.”

“The #777 deserved the win – they were stronger
  the whole weekend. But sometimes you just have bad luck in racing.
  Unfortunately, the weather decided the race today. Apart from that,
  four wins in five races make this an extraordinary year for BMW M
  Motorsport and Team WRT. We need to enjoy and celebrate that – it
  doesn’t happen every year. I’m very proud to have contributed a small
  piece of history in my first year with BMW M Motorsport.”

“I’m obviously very happy for BMW M Motorsport to
  secure the championship in Indianapolis. It was a bizarre race with
  the thunderstorm and the rain, which unfortunately prevented us from
  really racing for most of the event. The #777 was very strong the
  whole weekend and was ahead of us at the time of the red flag – they
  definitely deserved the win today. But the most important thing is
  that BMW won.”

“I’m really happy – it was a great weekend. These kinds of
  races are the ones I really enjoy, and I also learn a lot from them. I
  think I did a good job in the first two hours. The #777 had great pace
  but was very unlucky. Overall, I’m very happy with the weekend and my
  performance because I really enjoyed it.”

“We had a lot of fun together as teammates. There’s just a
  great atmosphere within BMW. The race itself hurts a bit. The main
  goal was to secure the championship for BMW – and we did that, which
  makes me very happy. We won many races this season, and I’m very happy
  for Kelvin; he deserves it. But of course it hurts, and we’ll try
  again next year.”

“It was great to race with Random Vandals Racing. The team is
  fantastic, and the car was perfectly prepared. We were competitive
  from the very start of the weekend. The Superpole went perfectly – the
  car was great, and I managed a strong lap. The first stint was a lot
  of fun; fighting my way through the field from tenth after the penalty
  was great. Unfortunately, we had to retire because we lost too many
  laps due to a technical issue. But for me, it was a great experience
  racing with this team, and I’d love to come back.”

“It was a crazy race with the weather, but we had
  the clear goal of winning the title. Our competitors dropped out
  early, so we had to be smart, sensible, and mistake-free – and in the
  end, we came home third. It was a great season with Justin; he’s
  improved so much in just one year. To be back-to-back Pro-Am Champions
  is something very special. A huge thank you to Turner Motorsport and
  BMW M Motorsport for all the support.”

“I’m very happy about the GT World
  Challenge America title. It’s my first championship since joining BMW
  M Motorsport. Kenton and the team did a fantastic job. It would have
  been nice to fight for the win here, but we had to secure our
  championship points. Still, it was a good day, a great year, and I’m
  already looking forward to 2026.”
