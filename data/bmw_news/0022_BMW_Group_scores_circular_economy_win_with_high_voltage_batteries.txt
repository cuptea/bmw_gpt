With electric mobility continuing to gather
  pace, recycling high-voltage batteries is increasingly under the
  spotlight. After successfully launching a closed-loop recycling system
  for the reuse of raw materials from high-voltage batteries thanks to
  the BMW Brilliance Automotive Joint Venture (BBA) in China in 2022,
  the BMW Group has now hit another milestone on its journey. On 1
  November 2024, it launched a pan-European partnership with SK tes, a
  leading provider of innovative technology lifecycle solutions. The
  special recycling process recovers cobalt, nickel and lithium from
  used batteries before returning them to the value chain to make new
  batteries. This closed-loop system is set to expand to the
  US-Mexico-Canada region as early as 2026.

Its long-term partnership with SK tes sees the BMW Group
  directly involved in the practical recycling processes, allowing it to
  feed back valuable insights to the development departments. Moving
  forward, high-voltage batteries from BMW Group development, production
  and markets in Europe that are no longer fit for use are to be
  delivered to SK tes in what is the first step towards an effective and
  sustainable circular economy for batteries. SK tes then converts the
  old batteries into high-quality metals that can be reintroduced to
  battery production. The latter process sees the batteries mechanically
  shredded, during which the metals are concentrated to leave a material
  called black mass. The valuable materials, namely nickel, lithium and
  cobalt, are then recovered in a highly effective chemical process
  called hydrometallurgy. Among other things, these secondary raw
  materials will be used for the new GEN 6 drive train.

"Partnerships like this increase our efficiency in terms of
  the circular economy. In the closed-loop process, all partners
  mutually benefit from their experiences," says Jörg Lederbauer,
  Vice President Circular Economy, Spare Parts Supply High Voltage
  Battery and Electric Powertrain at BMW AG.

The battery recycling process of SK tes has won numerous
  sustainability and innovation awards worldwide – from the Business
  Intelligence Group’s Sustainability Service of the Year to the UN
  Global Compact’s Apex Award.

"The promotion of circular economy is an
  important strategic topic for the BMW Group. The development of
  recyclable products, the increase of secondary materials in our
  components, and the closing of loops play an equally important
  role," says Nadine Philipp, Vice President Sustainability
  Supplier Network at BMW AG. "And by the means of circular economy
  we are also increasing our resilience in the supply chains."

The BMW Group follows the principles of Re:Think, Re:Duce,
  Re:Use, and Re:Cycle in the sense of a conservation of resources when
  it comes to circular economy. From vehicle design and production to
  recycling and reuse: everything is geared towards ensuring BMW
  vehicles become a raw materials source for new cars once they reach
  the end of their useful life. One such example is the BMW Group’s
  Recycling and Dismantling Centre. Over a period of 30 years now, the
  centre has developed processes and put them into practice, making key
  progress in parts and materials recycling.
