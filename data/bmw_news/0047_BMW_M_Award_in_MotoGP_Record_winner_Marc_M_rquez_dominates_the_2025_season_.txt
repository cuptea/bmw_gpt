Valencia. The winner of the 2025 BMW M Award in MotoGP™ is Marc
  Márquez. The record holder in this special competition has once again
  claimed the coveted prize for the fastest qualifier of the season –
  for the eighth time. The Spaniard had already made history by winning
  the BMW M Award seven years in a row between 2013 and 2019. Now
  Márquez has returned to the top. His prize this year is the new BMW M2
  CS (combined fuel consumption: 10.0 l/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions:
  226 g/km according to WLTP, CO₂ class: G)*. The presentation of the
  winner’s car took place on Saturday after the final qualifying session
  of the season at Valencia, Spain, where Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of
  MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports, and Axel Mittler, Marketing
  Manager at BMW M GmbH, handed over the keys.

After several challenging years, Márquez made an impressive comeback
  in 2025. He dominated the season and clinched the world championship
  title early, already in Japan at the 17th of 22 rounds. In the BMW M
  Award standings, Márquez collected so many points – with eight pole
  positions and five additional front-row starts – that he could no
  longer be caught, even though he missed the final four rounds of the
  season due to injury. Márquez won the 2025 BMW M Award with 351
  points, finishing eight points ahead of his brother Álex Márquez in
  second place. As in the races, MotoGP™ riders receive points for the
  BMW M Award according to their qualifying positions. The winner at the
  end of the season is awarded an exclusive high-performance automobile
  from BMW M. This coveted award has been presented every year since 2003.

Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of Dorna Sports, said: “Congratulations to Marc
  Márquez. He has made an impressive comeback this season and once again
  demonstrated why he is one of the greatest MotoGP riders of all time.
  From 2013 onwards, we handed him the keys to a new BMW M car seven
  times in a row at the season finale – and I am delighted that we can
  do so again this year. His performance and talent have been
  outstanding, and he truly deserves the BMW M Award this season. At the
  same time, my thanks go to BMW M GmbH. For 22 years now, the BMW M
  Award has been an integral part of MotoGP, making it a genuine
  tradition. It’s a special recognition of what our riders and their
  teams achieve weekend after weekend in qualifying.”

Axel Mittler added: “What Marc Márquez has shown this season was
  simply incredible. Congratulations to our record winner: seven
  consecutive victories were already historic, but his eighth BMW M
  Award triumph is truly remarkable, especially considering that he
  built such a big lead in the standings that even his injury couldn’t
  stop him from winning. We are delighted to add our new BMW M2 CS to
  Marc’s collection of BMW M Award winners’ cars. This high-performance
  sports car once again raises the benchmark in its segment, and with
  its pure performance, dynamics, and agility, it’s the perfect winner’s
  car for the currently world’s best MotoGP rider. We wish Marc lots of
  fun with his prize – and a smooth recovery, so that he can thrill us
  again next season!”

Marc Márquez said: “It took a few years, but I’m really happy to see
  my name back on the list of BMW M Award winners. This season has been
  a dream for me, even though I obviously didn’t imagine it ending with
  a shoulder injury that made me miss the final races. But it’s great to
  be here in Valencia and to be recognized once again as the fastest
  qualifier – for the eighth time! I actually found out I’d won while I
  was out buying fruit – my brother Álex didn’t manage the result he
  needed in the penultimate qualifying in Portimão to keep the contest
  open. But I promised him he’ll get to drive the car too! For us, it’s
  always something special when our performances on the track are
  recognized in this way. Now it’s time for the winter break, and my
  goal for 2026 is clear: to win the world championship, and this award, again!”

The 2025 winner’s car, the BMW M2 CS, is the latest exclusive special
  model from BMW M GmbH in the premium compact high-performance sports
  car segment. It impresses with outstanding agility, significantly
  increased performance, exceptional driving dynamics, and particularly
  sporty design features. The straight-six engine with M TwinPower Turbo
  technology and high-revving characteristics delivers an impressive 390
  kW/530 hp. Power is transmitted to the rear wheels via the standard
  8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. The BMW M2 CS
  accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds. Thanks to the
  extensive use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components in
  both the exterior and interior, the BMW M2 CS is also the lightest M2
  of the current generation.

As part of its extensive activities as the “Official Car of MotoGP™”,
  BMW M GmbH presents the BMW M Award at the end of each season to the
  best qualifier. Before Márquez extended his record in 2025 with his
  eighth victory, Francesco Bagnaia had won the coveted award for the
  past three years. The list of winners since the award’s introduction
  in 2003 also includes Valentino Rossi, Casey Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo,
  Fabio Quartararo, Sete Gibernau and Nicky Hayden.
