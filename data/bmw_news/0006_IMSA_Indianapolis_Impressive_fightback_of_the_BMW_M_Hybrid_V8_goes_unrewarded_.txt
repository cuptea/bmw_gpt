Their teammates Philipp Eng (AUT) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the #24
  BMW M Hybrid V8 were set back early on by a drive-through penalty. In
  a turbulent race with numerous full course yellow periods, they still
  managed to collect important championship points by finishing fourth.

There was plenty to celebrate at Paul Miller Racing. Max Hesse (GER)
  and Dan Harper (GBR) took the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from pole position to
  the podium in the GTD-PRO class. Harper had been unbeatable in
  qualifying, securing his first-ever pole award in the GTD-PRO
  category. On Sunday, Harper and Hesse fought for victory for a long
  time before eventually celebrating their third podium of the season
  with a strong third place finish.

Their teammates Neil Verhagen, Madison Snow and Connor De Phillippi
  (all USA) also showed strong pace in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO after
  starting from ninth. At the three-hour mark, they were even leading
  the GTD-PRO class ahead of the sister car, collecting important
  Endurance Cup points. After six hours, the local favourites crossed
  the line in eighth place in class.

Turner Motorsport also delivered a strong performance in the GTD
  category, moving up from 14th on the grid. Robby Foley, Patrick
  Gallagher and Jake Walker (all USA) narrowly missed the podium,
  finishing fourth in the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.

“After the
  1-2 finish at Road America, we once again showed strong performance
  here in Indianapolis with the BMW M Hybrid V8. Unfortunately, the
  impressive comeback by Marco and Sheldon was not rewarded with the
  podium they deserved. The fourth place for Dries and Philipp is a good
  result, especially considering the penalty, and brings important
  championship points. Congratulations to Paul Miller Racing on a strong
  weekend, highlighted by the pole position and the podium finish for
  the #48. Now we are looking forward to the season finale at Road Atlanta.”

“It was not an easy weekend. Our
  competition, especially Acura and Cadillac, simply had more pace than
  we did. Still, we had a solid race. The penalty was unfortunate, but
  race control had announced they would be very strict – and they were
  for the whole field. Dries did a great job in qualifying and
  especially at the end. With fourth place we scored important
  championship points.”

“Obviously not the result we hoped
  for in the end. We had the potential to achieve more. The car was
  stronger than we expected at the beginning of the weekend, which is
  very positive. We did many things very well this weekend. It’s
  encouraging to see that we are improving and moving in the right
  direction but there are also things we need to review. We will do that
  as a team to come back stronger for Petit Le Mans which is one of the
  biggest races of the year and one we would all love to win. Hopefully
  we can finish the year on a high.”

“It was a fantastic weekend. I’m really happy to be back on the
  podium after a few tough races. In the Endurance Cup we are right back
  in the title fight. At the three-hour mark we scored maximum points
  with both cars – and then added more with third place at the end. That
  puts us in a strong position for the finale at Petit Le Mans. My
  personal highlight was my first pole position yesterday. It was an
  amazing feeling, and I think we really deserved it this season. A few
  times I came very close, and the team always gave me a car capable of
  it so it was nice to get that one and now let’s move on to the last round.”
