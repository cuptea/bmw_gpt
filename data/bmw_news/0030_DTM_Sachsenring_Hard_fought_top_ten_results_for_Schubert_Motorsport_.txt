Schubert Motorsport experienced a rollercoaster ride at the sixth DTM race weekend of the season at the Sachsenring (GER). In the qualifying sessions, all three BMW M4 GT3s struggled, but impressive comebacks followed in the races.

Rast faced the most significant issues of the three BMW M works
  drivers in both qualifying sessions and had to start from last
  position in the races. However, he capitalised on the good race pace
  of his #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 and made up a total of 24 positions
  over the weekend. This resulted in a seventh-place finish on Saturday
  and ninth place on Sunday.

Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) fared better in his #31 Shell BMW M4 GT3
  during the qualifying, starting from 13th and 10th places. He improved
  several positions on Saturday, and his eighth place on Sunday was
  particularly remarkable, as he had to recover from a nearly hopeless
  position due to a punctured tyre early in the race. He never gave up
  and managed to fight back into the top ten after a safety car period.

Marco Wittmann (GER) encountered extreme misfortune at the
  Sachsenring. On Saturday, he was involved in a start collision that
  damaged the front of his #11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3. Despite the lack
  of downforce affecting his performance, he managed to finish the race
  in 13th place. On Sunday, after an excellent first stint from 19th and
  a promising pit stop, he was within reach of a top-five finish.
  However, he became an innocent victim of a collision involving Rast
  and Jordan Pepper (RSA, Lamborghini) behind him, which the race
  stewards deemed a normal racing incident.

Thanks to the strong comebacks, Schubert Motorsport was able to
  defend its lead in the DTM team standings. With 273 points, the team
  from Oschersleben (GER) holds a 22-point lead ahead of the remaining
  race weekends at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) and the Hockenheimring (GER).

“It's hard to put this DTM race weekend into
  words. On the plus side, the race pace was very strong for all BMW M4
  GT3s. Our drivers managed to overtake the most competitors on the
  track. Thanks to the fighting spirit and the points scored, things
  look very good for Schubert Motorsport in the team standings.
  Unfortunately, our guys lost ground in the drivers' standings. The
  main reason for this is, of course, the weakness in qualifying.
  There's a lot of work ahead for the team and drivers in this area, as
  starting the races from much further ahead would be a big help in the
  title fight. Marco Wittmann's experience at the Sachsenring painfully
  showed how quickly accidents can happen when you have to fight through
  the field.”

”It's
  obviously good to see that our car works well in the races and we can
  make up a lot of ground, but that's of no use if we can't find the
  pace in qualifying and have to start from so far back. We definitely
  need to understand and get a handle on this problem. I'm sorry about
  the accident on Sunday for Marco and Jordan. I had a good run out of
  the last corner and wanted to overtake Jordan. When I committed to the
  inside for the overtaking manoeuvre, he also moved inside, and I hit
  him. That was very unfortunate, but a racing incident.”

): “I'm
  very proud of my guys' performance this weekend. I think we got the
  most out of the possibilities available to us here. There's nothing
  you can do about a tyre puncture like that; it happens. Nevertheless,
  we take a lot of positives with us looking forward to the upcoming events.”

“The
  weekend was extremely frustrating. When you get hit as hard as I did
  on Sunday in turn one, there's nothing you can do. That's even more
  annoying because we were having a very good race up to that point. We
  had good tyre management and pace and were on a similar strategy to my
  win at Zandvoort. The plan for the second stint was to keep attacking
  and maybe even go for the top five. That's why the retirement is
  brutally disappointing.“
