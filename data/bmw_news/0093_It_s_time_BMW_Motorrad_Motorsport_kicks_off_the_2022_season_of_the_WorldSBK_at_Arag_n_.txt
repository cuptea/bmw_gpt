The preparation phase is over, now it’s time for action. This weekend (8th to 10th April), BMW Motorrad Motorsport gets started in the FIM Superbike World Championship 2022 (WorldSBK) at MotorLand Aragón, Spain. This season, the two BMW teams, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, are fielding a total of four BMW M 1000 RRs.

BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s BMW newbie Scott Redding (GBR) will
  contest his first races on the BMW M 1000 RR. His team-mate Michael
  van der Mark (NED), not starting at the Aragón opener due to injury,
  will be replaced by BMW works rider Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR). Bonovo
  action BMW Racing Team is also fielding two motorbikes this season.
  They will be ridden by Eugene Laverty (IRL), who is entering his third
  year as a BMW works rider, and BMW newcomer Loris Baz (FRA).

Both mornings of testing at the start of the week were extremely cold
  with temperatures around freezing. Things warmed up slightly as the
  days went on, and the two teams and riders used the 45-minute sessions
  to work on the tuning of the BMW M 1000 RR for the season opener.

At MotorLand Aragón, in addition to the four works motorbikes, a
  fifth BMW M 1000 RR will be competing. The Italian privateer B-Max
  Racing Team will contest the season opener with wildcard rider
  Gabriele Ruiu (ITA).

Before the season opener gets underway with the first free practice
  sessions on Friday, BMW Motorrad Motorsport invites all accredited
  media representatives to a media presentation at BMW Motorrad WorldSBK
  Hospitality on Thursday evening. BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc
  Bongers, Shaun Muir, Team Principal of BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team,
  Michael Galinski, Team Principal of Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, and
  the four works riders Redding, Laverty, Baz and Mikhalchik will be on
  hand for informal chats. The highlight of the evening is a cinematic
  surprise in which the BMW Motorrad works riders demonstrate their
  theatrical talent. The media presentation at BMW Motorrad WorldSBK
  Hospitality in the paddock gets underway at 6.00 p.m. CEST on Thursday
  7th April.

“After a winter break of four months it is always exciting to
  start the new season. Lots is new for us. For one thing, we have
  developed the BMW M 1000 RR in many areas. We have also strengthened
  ourselves in terms of riders and are now competing with a quartet that
  combines speed with a wealth of WorldSBK experience. Scott Redding is
  new to BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, and we are confident that it won’t
  take him long to get used to the BMW M 1000 RR. Unfortunately, Michael
  van der Mark’s fractured leg means that he is unable to be there for
  the opener. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope to have him back at
  the track soon. Ilya Mikhalchik is a good replacement who will help us
  gain further valuable insights into the motorbike in the first few
  races. At Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, Eugene Laverty brings his
  combined experience, and alongside Loris Baz forms a strong rider
  pairing that will allow the team to take a big step forward in the
  WorldSBK. We are setting ourselves realistic goals for the Aragón
  opener. We are aiming to be up there in the top five initially, and
  then be battling for the lead as soon as possible.”

“Because
  of the cold track conditions it was hard to do the work really
  consistently, but we were working on a few things. One of them was
  rear grip; we are still struggling in that area at the moment. In the
  end it was another circuit we have come to, it was a bit different, so
  we had to play a lot with the bike set-up to get more of a feeling but
  we are still not achieving the feeling that we want to have so we
  still have some more work to do. Now I am looking forward to the first
  race on the BMW. It’s going to be hard, for sure, but this is where we
  can collect more race data for me to ride with the other guys and
  understand the riding style a little bit more. The expectation? We
  need to see. At the moment we are not quite where we want to be but we
  have a couple of days to come with some more solutions and then we’ll
  try again and see if we can improve.”

“On
  these two days of testing we tried a lot of new things for the
  upcoming season. We found a lot of positive things, so I think that
  Scott and Michael can make another step during the season on the bike
  so we are happy with that. Then in the end I focused on my settings
  for the race weekend to be well prepared. For sure, I am really
  excited to compete in my first WorldSBK races and first of all I want
  to say a big thank you to BMW for this opportunity. Secondly I wish
  Michael that he gets well soon and back on his bike as fast as
  possible. For now I do his job and so far it is looking quite well for
  me. I get a better feeling for the bike with every lap. I am really
  confident for the race week because I know the track, I know the bike
  and the team now, so we can do a good job in my first WorldSBK races.”

“We
  still have some work to do. The good thing here is that we have the
  race weekend at the same track so we can continue and try to improve
  in our weak areas but the two days of testing have been beneficial,
  even if I still want more. I like the Aragón track and in the past
  have often been strong here. It’s the first race weekend with the
  Bonovo action BMW Racing Team and so far it has been a fantastic
  atmosphere in testing so I am excited to start the season. The weather
  will be much warmer at the weekend compared with this test so that
  changes everything. So let’s see, it will be good fun.”

“It has
  been a strange test because it was really cold but the Pirelli tyre
  works well in the cold, like always. Overall I am happy with the
  improvement we made, even if I am not completely satisfied with the
  bike yet. The most important thing is that we are going into the right
  direction, we make the right changes and I think that everything we
  tried was pretty good. I am happy with the job we do with BMW and the
  Bonovo action BMW Racing Team. It’s great that we could continue the
  good work we made at Misano after the difficult Barcelona test. Now I
  am excited to go into the first race weekend. I’m a race guy and all I
  want is to be on the grid so it is really great to start again. The
  first weekend is always interesting because you build from there so it
  is an important weekend as a base for the rest of the season. I hope
  we can continue with the same feeling we had at the test, trying to
  make improvement again on the race pace. Let’s see what we can
  achieve. If we could be in the top-six with the pace we had at the
  test would be really good.”
