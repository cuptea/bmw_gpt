Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good Morning.

In the third quarter of 2025, the BMW Group continued its strategic
  course and maintained its global market position.

But before we dive into the details of the quarter, I would like to
  directly address our communication from October 7th.

You all know the BMW Group as an ambitious company.

We have always focused on identifying opportunities and realizing
  market potential, and our success demonstrates that this is the right approach.

In 2025, despite all known challenges, we were confident in the
  fundamental potential of the Chinese market.

Our planning scenario was fully confirmed during the first six
  months, with a performance on the level of the second half of 2024.

For the second half of this year, we assumed we would see growth momentum.

However, at the beginning of the fourth quarter we observed that this
  momentum had not materialized to date.

So, for the remainder of 2025, volume stabilization, rather than
  volume growth, now appears likely. Accordingly, we have adjusted our
  planning and now anticipate a consistent monthly run rate in China in
  line with the first half of 2025.

In addition, we have introduced measures to support the profitability
  and liquidity of our dealers in China.

These measures will also have an impact on our Q4 profitability.

The consolidation of our dealer network in China is progressing to plan.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

With respect to tariffs, the BMW Group has been fully transparent
  throughout the year concerning the impact on our 2025 financial results.

Our original guidance given in March as well as our updated
  assessments in the Q1 and Q2 reporting were based on certain assumptions.

As mentioned in our ad-hoc announcement, these assumptions were not
  fully realized as expected to date.

We now anticipate a tariff-related headwind of 1.5 percentage points
  on the Auto EBIT margin for the full year.

I will share further details on our full-year outlook later on.

But now, let me walk you through our Q3 figures.

Group earnings before tax totaled over 2.3 billion euros in the third
  quarter and exceeded 8 billion euros year-to-date through September.

Compared to the first nine months of 2024, this represents only a
  slight decrease of 9.1 percent – a notable achievement in light of the
  current developments in the Automotive industry.

And for the full year, we also expect a decrease in the single-digit
  range only.

This represents a full-year Group profit before tax of approximately
  10 billion euros – despite the significant burden of higher tariffs.

Excluding the impact of tariffs, pre-tax profit even exceeds the 2024 figure.

Within the BMW Group ecosystem, every segment contributes to our
  overall success.

The reported Group EBT margin stood at 7.2 percent in the third
  quarter and 8.1 percent year-to-date through September.

The reported Auto EBIT margin fell within our full-year target
  corridor for both Q3, at 5.2 percent, and year-to-date through
  September, at 5.9 percent.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

As you know, the BMW Group is always transparent in its reporting,
  and we consistently focus on communicating our published figures.

For better comparability within the industry, allow me, nevertheless,
  to provide a few additional details regarding our operational
  performance in the Automotive segment.

First: Auto EBIT includes the depreciation resulting from the
  purchase price allocation of BBA.

Excluding this depreciation, which amounts to approximately 1.1
  percentage points, the quarterly margin would be 6.3 percent, and the
  nine-month margin would be 7.0 percent.

Second: Auto EBIT also includes the burden of extra tariffs, which
  amounts to around 1.75 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.5
  percentage points through September.

This impact should also be added for a fair comparison of our EBIT margin.

Q3 deliveries to customers at Group level increased solidly by 8.7
  percent year-on-year.

After nine months, the share of all-electric vehicles reached 18
  percent of total sales.

And with a share of 26.2 percent, more than one in four vehicles sold
  globally was electrified, meaning either a BEV or a plug-in hybrid.

Let’s now take a look at how the Automotive Segment performed across
  key metrics.

Deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers reached
  588,140 units in the third quarter.

In Europe, sales grew by 9.3 percent, and in the US by 24.9 percent.

In China, retail sales did not meet our expectations, with deliveries
  at previous year’s level.

After nine months, global retail sales approached 1.8 million units,
  representing a slight increase of 2.4 percent.

This clearly demonstrates the strength of our global business model,
  with sales performance in Europe and the US more than compensating the
  challenges in China.

Sales of all-electric vehicles exceeded 100,000 units for the sixth
  consecutive quarter.

Q3 revenues in the Automotive segment amounted to 28.5 billion euros,
  reflecting a slight increase of 2.4 percent year-on-year. Adjusted for
  currency translation effects, the increase was 6.4 percent.

Segment EBIT amounted to approximately 1.5 billion euros in Q3 and
  5.1 billion euros from January to September.

The reported EBIT margin – including the negative impact of BBA PPA
  and tariffs – came in at 5.2 percent for the quarter and 5.9 percent
  as of September.

That brings me to my next slide, taking a detailed look at our
  operating result of the third quarter year-on-year.

Automotive EBIT increased by around 900 million euros compared to Q3 2024.

As anticipated at mid-year, changes in currencies negatively impacted
  EBIT by 500 million euros, while raw material positions remained neutral.

The net effect of volume, model mix and pricing resulted in a
  negative impact of 300 million euros in the third quarter, compared to
  the previous year.

Both volume and model mix provided a tailwind, while pricing was a headwind.

This is particularly evident in China, where we see price pressure
  across all segments.

Furthermore, since the end of June, Chinese banks have significantly
  reduced dealer commissions.

While this led to a certain increase in transaction prices, as
  expected, it could not offset the negative impact of the lower
  commission revenues for dealerships.

Consequently, we implemented dealer support measures in Q3 to
  strengthen dealer profitability and liquidity.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In line with our planning, we will continue to decrease our operating
  costs in 2025 and beyond.

This trend is once again reflected in our figures for the third quarter.

Research and development expenses decreased by about 300 million
  euros compared to the prior-year quarter.

Group R&D expenditure totaled 5.9 billion euros as of September.
  This remains significantly below last year's level, despite extensive
  product initiatives and intensive preparations for the first models of
  the NEUE KLASSE.

The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code stood at
  5.9 percent after nine months.

Selling and administrative expenses decreased by around 200 million
  euros compared to the previous year.

These nominal cost savings of 500 million euros more than offset the
  negative impact from volume, model mix and pricing.

Other Cost Changes provided a tailwind of around 1.2 billion euros
  compared to the third quarter of 2024.

This development results mainly from three areas:

On the one hand, warranty expenses were significantly lower year-on-year.

In Q3 2024, we fully recognized the necessary warranty provisions for
  the Integrated Braking System.

On the other hand, tariffs had a negative impact of around 1.75
  percentage points on the Auto EBIT margin in Q3.

The majority of the improvement in other cost changes in Q3 results
  from the positive development of manufacturing costs and material costs.

Overall, we reduced costs by over 1 billion euros in the third
  quarter and by approximately 2 billion euros year-to-date through September.

In addition to EBIT, tariffs also affect free cashflow.

While refunds are recognized in EBIT, cash will rather be recognized
  in 2026 than in 2025.

This negatively affected free cashflow through September, and the
  timing effect alone will impact free cashflow for the full-year by a
  high three-digit million euros amount.

Free cash flow in the Automotive Segment totaled 343 million euros in
  the third quarter.

Earnings before tax amounted to 1.4 billion euros.

The net change in working capital contributed positively to free
  cashflow by around 300 million euros.

The negative net effect of capital expenditure and depreciation
  impacted the third quarter by 300 million euros.

The capex ratio was 5.2 percent in the third quarter and 4.4 percent
  for the first nine months.

Following the peak in 2024, capex will decrease for the full year
  2025. The capex ratio is projected to remain below 6 percent.

Changes to provisions negatively impacted free cash flow in the third
  quarter by approximately 400 million euros.

This was primarily due to the consumption of warranty provisions.

The change in the position Other, amounting to around 600 million
  euros, includes income taxes paid.

After nine months, free cash flow in the Automotive segment stands at
  almost 2.7 billion euros.

For the full year, we now target a free cash flow of over 2.5 billion
  euros, compared to the original forecast of over 5 billion euros.

This is driven by two factors:

Lower-than-expected earnings for the full year

And tariff refunds that we expect to receive in 2026 instead of 2025

We remain committed to shareholder returns using both dividends and
  share buyback.

Despite the lower free cashflow outlook, we will maintain our
  dividend payout ratio of 30 to 40 percent and will continue our share
  buyback program as announced.

As a result, the anticipated shareholder returns for the financial
  year 2025 will exceed free cashflow.

Let’s now turn to our Financial Services segment.

Financial Services is a key component of our customer journey and an
  important part of our integrated value chain.

As a vital element of our financial operating model, the segment
  contributes consistently to our Group profit.

New business grew significantly during the third quarter, primarily
  driven by the changed competitive environment in China.

This contributed to a slight year-on-year increase of 1.9 percent in
  new leasing and financing contracts concluded with retail customers
  over the nine-months-period.

New business volume increased by 4.2 percent to 48.5 billion euros.

The penetration rate for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.1
  percentage points to 46.4 percent.

Segment earnings amounted to more than 1.8 billion euros, a
  year-on-year decrease of 14.4 percent.

The decline is primarily attributable to the lower income from the
  resale of end-of-lease vehicles as well as a tax payment in the second
  quarter resulting from a revised operational tax assessment for prior years.

Resale income remains positive on a portfolio basis.

The credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained low
  at 0.26 percent.

In the Motorcycles Segment, deliveries increased solidly by 5.7
  percent year-on-year.

EBIT for the second quarter totaled 60 million euros, resulting in an
  EBIT margin of 7.9 percent.

Let’s now turn to our outlook for the 2025 financial year.

Four weeks ago, we confirmed that the Auto EBIT margin will remain in
  the guided corridor of 5 to 7 percent – more specifically in the range
  of 5 to 6 percent.

We also confirmed that deliveries in the Automotive segment are
  expected to increase slightly.

At the same time, the BMW Group adjusted its guidance for the
  following two key performance indicators:

Group Profit before Tax, which we now anticipate to decrease slightly
  compared to 2024

Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) in the Automotive segment, which is
  now expected in a corridor between 8 and 10 percent

In the Motorcycles segment, deliveries are now expected to decrease
  slightly, whilst the EBIT margin range is confirmed between 5.5 and
  7.5 percent.

In the Financial Services segment, we confirm a Return on Equity
  (RoE) in the range of 13 to 16 percent.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We have invested early and significantly in the future of our
  company, in line with our long-term strategy.

Our technology clusters are ready – paving the way for the broad
  deployment of innovations across our complete product portfolio.

Our Gen6 battery technology will shortly hit the market and support
  profitability with cost savings of 40 to 50 percent for the battery pack.

After reaching their peak levels in 2024, we are reducing both capex
  and R&D, as planned.

We are also maintaining our consistent management of operational
  costs. This is reflected in our figures for the third quarter and
  through September, and it will continue to be visible going forward.

With our highly attractive products and the NEUE KLASSE, we have the
  right levers in place to continuously strengthen our global market
  position, today and in the future.

We believe that our 2025 profitability stands out in the current
  business environment, with a pre-tax profit decline only in the
  single-digit percentage range year-on-year.

And with our strong balance sheet as a solid foundation, we will
  deliver consistent returns for our stakeholders.

Thank you.
