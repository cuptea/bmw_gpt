+++ Mobility Partner BMW hands over new vehicles for the Olympic
  season to Germany's top biathletes +++ Athlete presentation and
  competition start at BMW Welt +++ New BMW iX3 leads the field +++ LOOP
  ONE Festival in Munich's Olympic Park thrills 50,000 fans +++

Munich's Olympic Park was the venue last
  weekend for the premiere of the LOOP ONE Festival, where the biathlon
  elite kicked off the new season. Before the competitions began on
  Sunday in the BMW Welt, the German National Team delighted fans on
  Saturday afternoon with an appearance on the main stage at the Olympic
  Stadium. Selina Grotian, Janina Hettich-Walz, Franziska Preuß, Vanessa
  Voigt, Johannes Kühn, Philipp Nawrath, Danilo Riethmüller, and Justus
  Strelow received symbolic licence plates with their names and the BMW
  model they had chosen for the new season. BMW is the Mobility Partner
  of the DSV Biathlon and a Partner of the LOOP ONE Festival.

“We promise the German team a relaxed journey on the 'Road to Gold'
  with the new BMW vehicles. I am confident that the cars have enough
  space for some precious metal,” said Christian Ach, Head of BMW
  Germany, during the vehicle handover. “BMW and all its employees wish
  you great success for this weekend, the entire season, and safe
  travels at all times.”

The biathletes then took time for their fans, signing autographs
  before seizing a special photo opportunity. A new, fully electric BMW
  iX3, the first vehicle of the Neue Klasse, was displayed inside an
  oversized snow globe. The national team clearly enjoyed the moment.

The competitions on Sunday started at the BMW Welt. The new BMW iX3
  served as the lead vehicle for the first part of the course. During
  the super sprint on roller skis, the final consisted of five laps of
  1.8 kilometres each, with two shooting rounds in both standing and
  prone positions. In front of approximately 50,000 spectators, Eric
  Perrot from France won the men's competition. Despite three missed
  targets, he crossed the finish line first in 20:33.7 minutes, ahead of
  Norway's Isac Frey (3 missed targets/+5.7 seconds) and Germany's
  Justus Strelow (1/+8.9). In the women's competition, Italy's Lisa
  Vittozzi claimed a comfortable victory. With two missed targets, she
  finished in 23:44.5 minutes, ahead of Sweden's Johanna Skottheim
  (2/+5.9) and Anna Magnusson (2/+7.4), who took second and third place, respectively.
