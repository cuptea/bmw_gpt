The BMW Group is maintaining its course for
  profitable growth in a volatile business environment. The company once
  again reaffirmed its leading position in the global premium segment,
  with a solid increase in sales to

in the third quarter and

units
  over the nine-month-period (Q3 2022: 587,744
  units/

; 2022: 1,747,838 units/

The BMW Group combined this growth with a strong financial
  performance: The

  depreciation for BBA assets from the purchase price allocation, the
  EBIT margin was

(Q3/2022: 10.1%) and

(Sept YTD/2022: 11.7%) after nine months.

The company is still on track to deliver an

. These gains are mostly expected to come from
  higher-priced models and fully-electric vehicles. By the third
  quarter, battery-electric vehicles accounted for

of total sales, already meeting the 15% target planned for
  the full year (2022: 8.9%/+69.7%). Over the nine-month period, the
  percentage of BEVs climbed to

(2022: 7.3%/+83.6%).

“Our third quarter showed once again that strong products generate
  strong demand – across all drive technologies. This puts us right on
  track to meet the higher targets we set ourselves in August,” said

, on Friday. “In parallel with today's successful business,
  we are also setting the course for the future: With the BMW Vision
  Neue Klasse, we presented nothing less than the future of the car at
  the IAA MOBILITY. In this way, we are already bringing the mobility
  for the next decade to the roads in 2025.”

The growth trend for BMW continued in many of the world’s automotive
  markets in the third quarter: Compared to the previous year, the
  supply situation improved – making it easier to meet demand for
  vehicles. BMW Group deliveries trended higher in the main regions of
  the Americas and Europe, while Asia was on a par with last year.
  Germany and Europe made significant gains (Europe: 221,735
  units/+12.9%; Germany: 68,569 units/+12.4%) and the US market posted
  solid growth of 7.7%, with a total of 92,218 vehicles delivered to
  customers (2022: 85,631 units). In China, the BMW Group delivered
  210,659 units in China (2022: 214,565/-1.8%). From January to
  September, the BMW brand saw a slight increase in the market (+3.4%),
  thus exceeding the overall Chinese market development (+2.4%). Total
  BMW Group deliveries in China rose to 603,920 vehicles (594,089
  units/+1.7%) in the year to the end of September. The slightly reduced
  increase year on year was mainly due to MINI model change.

The biggest increase was in deliveries of

Between July and September, the BMW
  Group

sold a total of

(2022: 52,305 vehicles/

  the year to the end of September, BEV deliveries almost doubled,
  climbing

(2022: 128,195 units). This sales growth
  derived largely from the

, with BEV
  deliveries up

in the first nine months.

The company is pushing forward with electrification of its product
  range: With the launch of the new BMW i5* and the upcoming Rolls-Royce
  Spectre*, all three premium brands will have at least one
  fully-electric variant across the relevant segments. By 2024, one in
  five of the company’s new vehicles will be a BEV; by 2025, one in four.

Growth is expected to get a further boost in the fourth quarter from
  the BMW Group’s diverse and attractive product line-up, including the
  all-new 7 Series models, the BMW 5 Series and the BMW X1, which is
  particularly popular in Europe.

with solid growth in
  the year to the end of September to

(2022: € 103,088
  million/

). In addition to full integration of
  the operating business of BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BBA) into
  the Automotive Segment, higher sales volumes and positive product mix
  effects supported the increase. Headwinds came from currency
  translation effects, especially for the Chinese renminbi and US
  dollar. In the year to the end of September, the greatest negative
  impact came from volume-related manufacturing cost.

By the end of September 2023, BBA’s operating result had been fully
  and uniformly integrated due to full consolidation; in the prior-year
  period, this was only the case from 11 February 2022. This must be
  factored into the year-on-year comparison.

  solid increase from last year. In addition to development expenses for
  new models such as the new BMW 5 Series and those of the NEUE KLASSE,
  R&D spending was primarily focused on further electrification and
  digitalisation of the vehicle fleet and automated driving. For
  example, the innovative “BMW OS 9” operating system is being rolled
  out this year. The partially automated, “hands-free” Level 2+ driving
  functions in the new 5 series and the highly automated Level 3
  functions have also been advanced.

  of € 7.7 billion had substantially boosted the BMW Group's financial

  2,659,869 shares of common stock and 530,588 shares of preferred
  stock, which were recognised as treasury shares. During the third
  quarter, the 24,123,400 own shares (22,199,529 common shares and

“We are steering our core business along a long-term, profitable
  growth path. To do this, we are making significant investments in our
  future: We are digitalising and electrifying our products and bringing

“The free cash flow in the Automotive Segment illustrates the

  environment, from stable cash inflows. In the fourth quarter, we plan

  other hand, the increase of capex ratio to around 6% (September YTD:

The upcoming market launch of the new R 1300 GS in the fourth quarter
  will be the most important product highlight of the year. As the
  world’s most successful premium motorcycle, the redesigned Boxer GS,
  with its many innovations, should be one of the segment's main
  profitable sales drivers.

The BMW Group forecasts overall growth for the global automotive
  markets year on year. In Europe and in the US, markets should grow
  robustly in 2023. The most optimistic forecast for China’s automotive
  market expects a slight growth year on year.

For the rest of the year, the company expects stable business
  development and confirms its forecast for financial year 2023 for all
  segments. This assumes that the geopolitical and macroeconomic
  conditions do not significantly deteriorate.

Due to improved vehicle availability, a healthy volume of orders and
  positive volume development overall, the company is planning for

The BMW Group is committed to long-term, profitable growth as it
  continues its transformation process. Through systematic investment
  and a commitment to being a pacesetter and driving force for
  innovation in its industry, the BMW Group aspires to a leading role in

Battery Electric Vehicle.

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed
  over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease
  contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end
  users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a
  service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third
  parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers
  when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group.
  Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international
  subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party
  dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of
  deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party
  dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do
  not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises
  in respect of that particular reporting period.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result
  comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative
  expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

Return on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and
  Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment
  profit before financial result and the average amount of capital
  employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment
  concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and
  non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not
  incur interest.

Return on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is
  calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average
  amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters –
  attributable to the Financial Services segment.
