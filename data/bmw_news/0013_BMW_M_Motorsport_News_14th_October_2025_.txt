"Congratulations to FK Performance Motorsport, Nick Wüstenhagen,
  and Ranko Mijatovic on winning the overall standings in the NLS! This
  marks the first time a team with the BMW M4 GT4 has finished a
  Nürburgring season on top. I am very proud of this achievement, as it
  not only highlights the outstanding performance of the team and
  drivers but also underlines the strong and highly competitive nature
  of the GT4 classes in the NLS. Our customer racing car regularly plays
  a leading role in the 'Green Hell' and delivers spectacular racing. I
  also want to congratulate all other winners and champions who compete
  with our cars in the NLS. Beyond that, our ambassadors around the
  world have celebrated further successes – whether in the GT4 European
  Series in Spain, the IMSA series in the USA, the Italian GT, or in
  Hungary at the GT Cup Series. Our customers are giving us plenty of
  reasons to celebrate as the season comes to a close, and I am very
  happy about that."

The new Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) champions are FK Performance
  Motorsport, Nick Wüstenhagen (GER), and Ranko Mijatovic (SUI). With an
  incredible streak of nine class victories in ten races, they secured
  the overall title in the 2025 Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) with
  the #187 BMW M4 GT4. Alongside their rotating co-drivers, Wüstenhagen
  and Mijatovic dominated the SP8T class. This marks not only FK
  Performance Motorsport’s first NLS overall title but also the first
  for the BMW M4 GT4. "We’ve been competing in the NLS as FK
  Performance since 2013, and it makes us very proud to now be crowned
  champions. This was definitely not an unlucky 13th year for us; it’s
  one of our greatest achievements," said team principal Martin Kaemena.

The Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels, which had won the
  championship for the past seven years, finished the 2025 season in
  fifth place overall with drivers Philipp Leisen, Philipp Stahlschmidt,
  and Daniel Zils (all GER) in the #500 BMW 330i. However, the trio
  claimed the Production Car Trophy. The first-ever champion of the
  newly introduced BMW 325i Challenge is Moran Gott from Adrenalin
  Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels. The Israeli driver secured nine
  victories, six of them as a solo competitor. In the BMW M240i class,
  Sven Markert and Kevin Wambach (both GER) triumphed, earning the team
  its third title of the season with a BMW race car.

In the final two races of the 2025 NLS season, NLS 9 and NLS 10, BMW
  teams achieved a total of 12 class victories with various BMW race cars.

BMW M Racing Academy participant Berkay Besler (TUR) concluded the
  GT4 European Series alongside Gabriele Piana (ITA) with a double
  podium finish. The duo from Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport finished
  second in the Silver Class on Saturday at the Circuit de
  Barcelona-Catalunya (ESP) after an intense battle for the lead. In
  Sunday’s season finale, Besler and Piana secured third place in the
  #12 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. With one victory at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) and
  six podium finishes in 12 races, they ended the season in a strong
  third place in the Silver Class. Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport also
  claimed second place in the team standings for the category. “It was a
  good weekend. Both drivers had strong qualifying sessions, and we ran
  two clean races. Gabriele and the entire team did a fantastic job
  throughout the season. I’m very happy with our performance this year.
  Six podiums in 12 races show how competitive we were. I’m already
  looking forward to next season,” said Besler.

The season finale was less fortunate for Jean-Mathieu Leandri and
  Antoni de Barn (both FRA) from CHAZEL Technologie Course. After five
  wins in the AM category during the first ten races, they arrived in
  Catalonia with title hopes. However, a collision in Saturday’s race
  left them without points for the first time this season, and they
  ultimately finished second in the overall standings.

At the season finale of the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge in Road
  Atlanta (USA), Turner Motorsport secured a podium finish with the #96
  BMW M4 GT4 EVO. BMW M works driver Robby Foley (USA) partnered with
  Beltre Curtis (USA), who made his series debut. Starting from
  13

, Curtis delivered a strong stint before handing over
  to Foley, who secured third place. Two other BMW M4 GT4 EVO cars
  finished fourth and fifth. Sean McAlister and Jeff Westphal (both USA)
  from CarBahn with Peregrine Racing finished fourth, narrowly missing
  out on the drivers’ title and ending the season second in the standings.

Turner Motorsport driver Jake Walker (USA) won both final races of
  the GSX class in the IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge at Road
  Atlanta (USA), finishing the season second in the drivers’ standings
  with the #6 BMW M4 GT3. Walker impressed with six consecutive wins and
  nine victories overall during the season. Despite scoring no points in
  the first two events of the year, he managed to secure second place
  overall. Samantha Tan (CAN) claimed the Bronze Cup title with two
  third-place finishes, which also counted as class victories, in the
  #38 BMW M4 GT3.

BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER) and Jesse Krohn (FIN)
  celebrated another podium finish in the Italian GT Championship. At
  the penultimate sprint weekend of the series at Imola (ITA), the duo
  finished third overall in Sunday’s race with the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO
  from BMW Italia Ceccato Racing. On Saturday, they finished seventh
  overall and fourth in the GT3-Pro class. Their teammates William
  Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA) also had reason to
  celebrate, finishing second and third in the GT3-Pro-Am class with the
  #2 car. The season finale will take place at the end of October at
  Monza (ITA), where BMW Italia Ceccato Racing aims to defend last
  year’s title.

The newly opened Balaton Park Circuit in Hungary hosted the season
  finale of the GT Cup Series. Šenkýř Motorsport represented BMW M with
  the BMW M4 GT4 and was unbeatable. Matyas Faiereisl (CZE) won the GT4
  class in both sprint races and the endurance race with the #9 BMW M4 GT4.

In the GT3 classes, the champions were already decided before the
  finale, and they also drove the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The 2025 GT3-Sprint
  champion is Rudolf Beňo (SVK) from Team Aries Racing. In the
  GT3-Endurance class, Gregor Szigo (SVK) and Dennis Waszek (CZE) from
  Racing Trevor claimed the championship. Beňo and his teammate Richard
  Gonda (SVK) finished second in the endurance standings.

Jake Hill (GBR) concluded the 2025 British Touring Car Championship
  (BTCC) season with another podium finish. At the finale in Brands
  Hatch (GBR), Hill drove the #1 BMW 330i M Sport from Team Laser Tools
  Racing with MB Motorsport to third place in the final race of the
  weekend. Hill finished the season, which had its ups and downs, fourth
  in the drivers’ standings.
