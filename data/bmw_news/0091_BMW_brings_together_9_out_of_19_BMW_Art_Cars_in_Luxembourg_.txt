"BMW Art Cars 9 out of 19" is a rare and exceptional
      exhibition dedicated to the famous collection of BMW models,
      decorated by internationally renowned artists. The exhibition is
      the result of the partnership between BMW Group Belux and
      Esch2022, with the support of the town of Esch-Sur-Alzette and is
      aimed at an audience with a keen interest in both art and cars. To
      celebrate the 50th anniversary of BMW M, you can discover 9 out of
      19 BMW Art Cars here.

At the venue visitors will be able to enjoy a surprising expo of
      no less than 1.200 square meters.

Luxembourgers' enthusiasm for cars manifests itself in many ways,
      for example, they have the best-preserved fleet of cars in the
      entire world. Art and culture are also high on their list of
      priorities in Luxembourg society. As such, the exhibition
      "BMW Art Cars - 9 out of 19" responds to two main
      interests of the public.

The opening of the exhibition on May 6 will be in the presence of
      Mr. Hervé Pulain, initiator of the Art Cars project in 1975. When
      Hervé Poulain was a young safety master and racing driver, he
      dreamed of participating in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans and
      combining his passion for art and speed. He then proposed to a car
      manufacturer to entrust him with a car, which he would then have
      painted by a well-known artist with the intention of making it an
      "Art Car". The first BMW 3.0 CSL with 480 hp was
      designed by Alexander Calder - followed by 18 others.

The exhibition will
      be held from May 7 to June 14 at Metzeschmelz - Usine d'Esch
      Schifflange (AES).
