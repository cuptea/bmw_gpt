Built on four continents, the BMW 3 Series
  has been one of the most important products in the BMW Group’s
  international production network for 50 years. Since manufacturing
  began in 1975, the BMW 3 Series has rolled off the assembly line more
  than 18 million times at 18 plants across 13 countries. Core themes of
  the BMW iFACTORY – such as efficiency, flexibility, digitalisation and
  resource-efficient production – thread consistently throughout the
  production history of the BMW 3 Series.

The main plant in Munich has been the centre of BMW 3 Series
  production since 1975. From an early stage, the BMW Group committed to
  flexible manufacturing at the site, enabled by modern technologies,
  such as overhead conveyor systems and freely programmable welding
  machines. A fully-automated body shop was introduced in Munich in 1982
  for the second generation of the BMW 3 Series. Through the use of
  industrial robots, it was possible to achieve an automation rate of
  more than 90 percent for this technology. Supplemented by flexible
  shift systems and modified work-time models, capacity increased
  significantly. Continuous modernisation, from powder coating
  technologies to computer-controlled engine production, ensured that
  the facility always remained state-of-the-art. Today, the plant
  deploys numerous digitalisation applications and AI-supported quality
  systems. In this way, the BMW 3 Series has consistently been a major
  driving force for the technological development of BMW Group production.

Volume growth at the plants was also influenced by the BMW 3 Series.
  In 1980, 3 Series production expanded from the main plant in Munich to
  Plant Dingolfing, and later to Plant Regensburg in 1986. The BMW 3
  Series also provided the momentum for the internationalisation of BMW
  production. In the 1980s, additional production lines were established
  at other sites, including Rosslyn, South Africa (from 1984) and
  Spartanburg in the United States (from 1994). These locations enabled
  local supply for their respective markets and laid the foundations for
  the company’s global distribution of value creation – today, a key
  feature of the BMW Group production network.

Since the opening of the Regensburg plant, the BMW 3 Series has
  served as the enabler for all new BMW plants – with the exception of
  the facility in Debrecen. The plants in Spartanburg, Leipzig and San
  Luis Potosí, as well as the BBA joint venture in China, all initially
  ramped up with the BMW 3 Series. Over the decades, various 3 Series
  derivatives – ranging from sedans and convertibles to Touring and M
  versions – have been produced at nearly all BMW Group plants with
  maximum flexibility. Multiple derivatives and different drive
  technologies – vehicles with internal combustion engines, plug-in
  hybrids and fully-electric drive trains – all come off the same
  assembly line.

Today, the seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series is produced in
  Munich, Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and at the
  company's own regional plants in Chennai (India), Rayong (Thailand)
  and Araquari (Brazil), as well as at partner plants in further countries.

Preparations for the eighth generation of the successful model series
  are proceeding in parallel: A fully-electric version of the BMW 3
  Series will ramp up at Plant Munich from the second half of 2026 as
  the next vehicle of the NEUE KLASSE, with subsequent production in
  China and Mexico. A return of the BMW 3 Series to Plant Dingolfing is
  also planned.
