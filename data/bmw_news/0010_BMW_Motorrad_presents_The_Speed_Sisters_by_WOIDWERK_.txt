Two extraordinary
  custom bikes from the Bavarian Forest made their debut at the BMW
  Motorrad Days 2025: the

builds by [WOIDWERK].
  Under the project name “The Speed Sisters,” Ralf Eggl – founder and
  creative force behind [WOIDWERK] – crafted two unique interpretations
  that captivated both motorcycle enthusiasts and custom scene insiders
  in Garmisch.

The goal of the project was to portray the BMW Motorrad cruiser
  models R 12 and R 18 as a custom-built sibling pair – stylistically
  connected, but deliberately not identical: “Sisters, not twins,” as
  Roland Stocker, Project Manager Heritage BMW Motorrad, puts it.
  Execution was led by Ralf Eggl, the visionary behind [WOIDWERK], with
  BMW Motorrad providing the two Boxer base bikes: a BMW R 12 as a
  dynamic retro cruiser and a BMW R 18 as a bold, powerful statement
  bike. The result is a custom duo that not only highlights the
  technical and stylistic relationship between the two models but also
  gives each its own distinct identity.

[WOIDWERK]’s interpretation of the BMW R 12 emphasizes lightness,
  agility, and a modern design language. The rear section was heavily
  shortened in classic bobber style, giving it a clean, minimalist look,
  while the riding position was made sportier thanks to a new handlebar,
  modified foot pegs, and a custom leather-and-Alcantara seat.

A bespoke tank cover with Alcantara surface was CAD-designed and
  3D-printed. Like on the R 18, it bears the project logo – a striking
  sign of the family connection. A chassis raised by 15 mm, featuring a
  Wilbers shock absorber, enables an actively engaged riding position.
  The sporty setup is further underscored by a deep-black exhaust system
  from Hattech with a special ceramic coating – understated in tone, yet
  always present.

The taillight design features elegant Kellermann Jetstream sequential
  indicators styled like aircraft wings, seamlessly integrated into a
  tailor-made, filigree tail cowl. The paintwork, executed by
  Lackierzentrum Hirsch, reflects the distinct color concept of the
  “Speed Sisters.”

The big sister also received a comprehensive custom makeover. Raising
  and narrowing the tank by 30 mm, along with a floating,
  selfsupporting seat and handcrafted “Targa hoop”, made the bike’s
  silhouette noticeably more dynamic.

  Corporate Communications The overall look and feel were sharpened both
  technically and visually: The standard braking system was upgraded to
  a high-performance radial setup – featuring 320 mm brake discs and
  radial brake calipers from the BMW R 1300 GS. This not only enhanced
  the sportiness visually, but also significantly improved braking performance.

Many components – from fairing brackets to the taillight housing to
  the signature swingarm end cap with integrated license plate holder –
  were custom-designed, CNC-milled, or 3D-printed. The indicator and
  taillight mounts on the swingarm are also in-house developments,
  reflecting [WOIDWERK]’s attention to detail.

The black ceramic-coated exhaust system by Hattech delivers a throaty
  sound that perfectly complements the muscular lines. As with the R 12,
  the individually crafted seat in leather and Alcantara with visible
  hand-stitching was created by Zinteriors.

Both bikes share a distinctive color scheme symbolizing the seasons
  of the Bavarian Forest: ¾ white, ¼ green – a tongue-in-cheek reference
  to the region’s famously long winters. This color ratio is reflected
  in the paintwork, seat upholstery, and the green-tinted fairing
  screens – a creative detail that drew much attention in Garmisch.
  “These are the colors of the Bavarian Forest,” says Ralf Eggl. “As we
  say here: Three-quarters of the year is winter, and the other quarter
  is cold – that’s the Bavarian Forest.”

The unveiling of “The Speed Sisters” at the BMW Motorrad Days 2025 in
  Garmisch-Partenkirchen created a real buzz among the crowd. The fusion
  of craftsmanship, attention to detail, and technical finesse won
  widespread praise, quickly making the bikes crowd favorites. Roland
  Stocker, Project Manager Heritage BMW Motorrad: “When Ralf Eggl said,
  ‘The Bavarian Forest is our home, and BMW is our passion,’ we knew
  [WOIDWERK] was the perfect partner for this project. His style blends
  local craftsmanship with technical sophistication and gives the two
  cruisers a new, authentic expression.”

For over a decade, [WOIDWERK] has stood for premium BMW-based custom
  builds – defined by precision craftsmanship, deep regional roots, and
  a distinct design language. With “The Speed Sisters,” Ralf Eggl once
  again proves his keen sense for form, function, and the brand DNA of
  BMW Motorrad.

This project confirms once more: customizing a BMW is more than just
  a question of style – it’s a statement of attitude, creativity, and
  true passion for motorcycles.
