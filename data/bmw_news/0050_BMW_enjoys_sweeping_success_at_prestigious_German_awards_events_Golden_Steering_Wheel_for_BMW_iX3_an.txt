BMW models have achieved outstanding results
  at two prestigious German awards events. The BMW iX3 (BMW iX3 50
  xDrive: energy consumption, combined: 17.9–15.1 kWh/100 km (WLTP);
  CO

emissions, combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); electric range:
  679–805 km (WLTP); CO

class(es): A)** – the first Neue
  Klasse model – won the “Golden Steering Wheel” as the “Best
  Innovation” of 2025. Another one of the “Golden Steering Wheels”
  awarded by German “Auto Bild” and “Bild am Sonntag” went to the BMW M5
  Touring (energy consumption, weighted, combined: 18.1–17.6 kWh/100 km
  and 5.3–5.0 l/100 km (WLTP); CO

emissions, weighted,
  combined: 119–114 g/km (WLTP); CO

classes: with discharged
  battery G, weighted, combined D–C; fuel consumption with discharged

, which
  effortlessly took the win in the “Upper/Luxury Class” category. The
  readers of German “Auto Zeitung” likewise considered BMW models
  superior. They voted for BMW vehicles as overall champions in no fewer
  than eight vehicle classes. The victorious models range from the BMW 1
  Series to the BMW 5 Series, from the BMW iX1 to the BMW X5. Vehicles
  powered by conventional internal combustion engines were as successful
  as battery-electric models like the new BMW iX3. In addition, BMW
  defended its title of “World’s Best Brand”.

“We offer our customers the ability to choose from a full range of
  exciting products across all segments, with all types of powertrains.
  The prestigious ‘Golden Steering Wheel’ and ‘Auto Trophy’ awards are a
  clear validation of our strategy, our products and the appeal of our
  brands,” said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW
  AG. “Since its world premiere in September, the BMW iX3 has been a
  sensation: pre-orders are even exceeding our high expectations,
  demonstrating an extraordinary level of customer interest. The fact
  that the BMW iX3 has now won two of Germany’s most prestigious
  automotive awards, even before its official market launch, underscores
  the pioneering role and the uniqueness of the BMW iX3.”

The “Golden Steering Wheel” is awarded by German “Auto Bild” car
  magazine and German weekly newspaper “Bild am Sonntag”, both published
  by Axel Springer SE. It counts among the most prestigious accolades of
  the European automotive industry. First presented in 1976, these
  annual awards honour outstanding new vehicles released on the German
  market. The nominations for the 49th iteration of the event comprised
  72 new models from 2025. Based on readers’ votes, three models in each
  vehicle class progressed to the finals at the German DEKRA-Lausitzring
  race track. Here, the top competitors faced a jury of race car
  drivers, industry experts and motor journalists from “Auto Bild” and
  “Bild am Sonntag”. Following comprehensive tests, the jurors awarded
  points ranking the vehicles’ everyday usability, quality,
  sustainability, powertrains and driving characteristics. Value for
  money and efficiency also formed part of the assessment.

The 2025 IAA Mobility show in Munich saw the world premiere of the
  new battery-electric BMW iX3 – the first Neue Klasse vehicle. The new
  BMW iX3 establishes a new design language and sets standards for
  driving dynamics and performance. A range of up to 805 kilometres,
  battery charging at up to 400 kW and a consumption of just 15.1
  kWh/100 km (WLTP) demonstrate the outstanding abilities of the new
  BMW iX3. Other highlights include the BMW Panoramic iDrive, which
  combines four central elements into one powerful unit. With the
  high-performance Heart of Joy central computer and BMW Dynamic
  Performance Control, the new BMW iX3 takes driving pleasure to an
  unprecedented level. That was also the motor journalists’ assessment
  as they awarded the BMW iX3 the “Golden Steering Wheel” for “Best
  Innovation”, thus adding to the large BMW trophy collection. Since
  2019, at least one of the coveted awards has gone to Munich every year.

The BMW M5 Touring won the “Golden Steering Wheel” in the
  “Upper/Luxury Class”. The performance car’s third generation features
  a new M Hybrid powertrain that combines an exhilarating V8 engine with
  a BMW eDrive motor integrated into the transmission, for a system
  output of 535 kW/727 hp. With its versatile luggage capacity of 500 to
  1,630 litres, the BMW M5 Touring offers even more everyday usability
  than a sedan – an advantage that was not lost on the jury. They also
  rated the performance model ahead of the other finalists in its class
  in all driving disciplines, as well as in terms of value for money and
  consumption. Overall, the BMW M5 Touring scored a higher points total
  than any other vehicle – of any class – in this year’s “Golden
  Steering Wheel” contest.

German car magazine “Auto Zeitung” has presented its “Auto Trophy”
  awards since 1987, making this one of the German automotive industry’s
  most established awards events. In 2025, there were around 400
  models/brands in 18 classes to choose from, reflecting the wide range
  of vehicles available on the German market. Between 10 September and
  21 October 2025, a total of 9,872 readers took part in the poll,
  registering their votes online or sending in ballot papers by mail. In
  the end, the magazine’s readers awarded BMW and its vehicles a total
  of nine “Auto Trophies”. Never before has a manufacturer been so
  successful in this established readers’ poll. The result even
  surpasses the brand’s very good achievement in 2024, when BMW garnered
  eight first places, and confirms that readers hold the current BMW
  model portfolio in very high esteem.
