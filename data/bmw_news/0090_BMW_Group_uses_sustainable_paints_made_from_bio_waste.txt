The BMW Group is using innovative
  technologies in its efforts to improve sustainability and taking
  advantage of new options to conserve resources and reduce emissions
  from painting bodywork. The BMW Group is the first automotive
  manufacturer worldwide to use matt paints made from biomass instead of
  crude oil at its European plants. In addition to this, BMW Group
  Plants Leipzig and Rosslyn (South Africa) are also using
  sustainably-produced corrosion protection. Renewable raw materials
  such as bio-waste or waste from sewage treatment plants serve as the
  starting material for the paints. The CO

savings
  determined in a TÜV-certified process amount to over 15,000 tonnes of
    CO

emissions between now and 2030.

“By reducing our use of fossil raw materials, we can conserve natural
  resources and lower CO

emissions at the same time. To
  achieve this, we are increasingly relying on sustainability
  innovations in our supplier network,” says Joachim Post, member of the
  Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier
  Network. “Innovative paints based on renewable raw materials are an
  important step in this direction.”

BASF’s innovative production process makes it possible to replace
  petroleum-based precursors, such as naphtha, with renewable raw
  materials from organic waste, starting in the early stages of paint
  production. This not only reduces consumption of fossil resources, but
  also avoids the CO

emissions associated with the
  production, transport and processing of crude oil.

The corrosion protection and matt paints used at BMW Group Plants
  Leipzig and Rosslyn are chemically identical to the paints previously
  used, with all the same properties as conventionally manufactured body
  coatings. Since bio-based and conventional coatings are produced on
  the same line, BASF adopts an externally certified mass balance approach.

The amount of paint purchased by the BMW Group is calculated to be
  exactly equivalent to the amount of bio-naphtha and bio-methane that
  would be required for 100-percent petroleum-free production. The
  sustainable manufacturing process reduces the CO

emissions
  from paint production by more than 40 percent. The two BMW Group
  plants in Leipzig and Rosslyn produce an average of around 250,000
  vehicles per year.
