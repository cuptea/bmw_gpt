The BMW Group is celebrating the
  100

anniversary of its Munich home plant. The company has
  been manufacturing its products as “Bayerische Motoren Werke” at the
  site in the Milbertshofen district since 1922. At an event to mark the
  anniversary, CEO Oliver Zipse emphasized how: “Our home plant – right
  in the heart of the metropolis that is Munich – has defied the
  elements of time. Because there have always been people who kept this
  site moving, always with the right instinct for the times and, above
  all, with a clear view to the future.” Lord Mayor Dieter Reiter spoke
  of a “strong commitment to Munich as a business hub.”

It all started with aircraft engines and motorcycles. Then, from
  1952, the plant moved on to start producing cars, which are still
  famous the world over to this day, including the iconic BMW Isetta,
  racing legends such as the M3 and, since 1975, the most successful of
  all BMW models: the BMW 3 Series. “Our roots are in Munich. This plant
  is our origin. And our future,” said Milan Nedeljković, Member of the
  Board of Management for Production at BMW AG: “It’s a high-tech
  production site. Around 900 top-quality BMWs leave this plant every
  day. Five different models with all types of drive. This proves the
  high flexibility, but also the vast breadth of experience and skills
  of the people who work here. They are the driving force behind
  everything that happens here.”

In its 100

anniversary year, the Munich plant is
  impressively demonstrating the leading role it plays in the age of
  electromobility. The all-electric BMW i4, for example, already makes
  up a quarter of the production volume – and rising: “The demand among
  our customers for the new BMW i4 is enormous – so we’re ramping up
  production even further. Next year already, every second vehicle
  leaving the Munich plant will be fully electric. Going by current
  plans, that means more than 100,000 BMW i4s from the heart of Munich
  for customers all over the world,” announced Oliver Zipse, with Milan
  Nedeljković adding: “This means that, by 2023, our home plant will
  already have achieved the BMW Group’s global goal for 2030, namely to
  increase our proportion of BEVs to 50 percent”.

“The introduction of the BMW i4 was an impressive feat of integration
  into an existing production system, and demonstrates the plant’s
  enormous capacity for transformation,” Plant Manager Peter Weber
  added. “Within less than five years, we have evolved from only
  producing combustion engines to producing hybrids and the fully
  electric i4. This means that we now manufacture five different models
  with all the different drive types on one production line. This shows
  that this factory truly understands transformation and is the
  embodiment of change and flexibility.”

In conjunction with the BMW Group’s Research and Innovation Center
  (FIZ), the Munich plant has always served as an internal center of
  excellence, disseminating knowledge about processes and technologies,
  as well as the experience gleaned from 100 years of engine and vehicle
  production to other plants around the world. Examples of this
  innovative prowess include producing the first series of the fully
  electric MINI E, the iconic Z8, and the electric special edition of
  the BMW 1602 for the Summer Olympics in 1972. Not to mention Project
  i, culminating in the revolutionary BMW i3, which also originated at
  the Munich plant.

The Munich plant’s strong position as a paragon of the BMW Group’s
  production network, now and in the future, is demonstrated by its
  transformation into an iFACTORY – the strategic master plan devised by
  BMW Group Production, emphasizing ‘lean’, ‘green’ and ‘digital’.
  Production Board Member Nedeljković: “The BMW iFACTORY epitomizes what
  we are aiming for with our production in the future and is setting new
  standards. We are implementing them globally, in all our plants – here
  in Munich as well as in our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary.”

The Munich plant’s structure is also undergoing transformation. The
  site of the former paint shop is being converted into a new body
  construction facility, and from 2024 the company will be constructing
  a completely new assembly to produce the all-electric ‘Neue Klasse’ on
  the site of the current engine-building facility. “This will keep the
  Munich plant competitive and ensure it remains a forward-looking
  production site,” emphasized Plant Manager Peter Weber.

Lord Mayor Dieter Reiter highlighted the fact that the plant has
  continued to evolve in parallel with the residential urban area that
  surrounds it and has remained a valuable employer: “The BMW parent
  plant in Munich has played a particularly significant role in BMW’s
  success story, which spans over 100 years. It has produced pioneering
  vehicles – such as the Neue Klasse in the 1960s and the 3 Series –
  which were instrumental in making the company a success,” said Reiter
  at the anniversary event. “As a result, I am all the more pleased that
  BMW plans to develop its home plant in an innovative and sustainable
  way according to its ‘urban production’ motto, taking into account the
  industry’s transformation toward electromobility and digitalization.
  This is a strong commitment to Munich as a business location and to
  securing and creating jobs in our city in the long term. I would like
  to thank the company for this endeavor and offer my sincere
  congratulations on the 100

anniversary of BMW’s first
  plant,” Reiter added.

The mayor also discussed the results of the recently concluded
  architecture competition “BMW Munich – Urban Production”, which the
  company launched in fall 2021 in partnership with the state capital
  Munich. The aim was to capitalize on the plant’s unique location in
  the city center. This will involve making the whole complex visibly
  more accessible and open to its neighbors.

The two winning offices, OMA from Rotterdam and 3XN from Copenhagen,
  decided on a joint endeavor to further develop their designs, and
  presented this concept to a high-caliber jury last week. Their vision
  for the future of production at the BMW Group plant in Munich will now
  be used to develop a new master plan.

With this master plan, as well as the structural optimizations
  already in the works, the Munich plant will focus on the BMW iFACTORY
  principles LEAN. GREEN. DIGITAL. Together, these principles ensure
  that this special site – the BMW Group’s century-old parent plant –
  will have maximum flexibility, excellent processes and outstanding
  integration capacities over the coming decades.
