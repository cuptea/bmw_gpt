Following its successful appearance at
  ApeFest 2024 in Lisbon, BMW was also in attendance at this year’s
  edition of the Web3 tech community event. This latest chapter in its
  collaboration with the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) community
  strengthened the connection between digital culture, technology and
  lifestyle. ApeFest 2025 took place on 24 October at first-time venue
  Las Vegas, and included a close-quarters tie-up with the ComplexCon
  event (25 – 26 October) fusing street culture, fashion, art and technology.

“We’re delighted to be collaborating with the Bored Ape Yacht Club
  (BAYC). The partnership gives us the opportunity to drive forward the
  digital transformation ‘in BMW style’ and to further expand our Web3
  knowledge. And this, in turn, will create a playground for innovative
  brand and product experiences from BMW,” says Ulrike von Mirbach, Vice
  President, BMW Customer Formats and Brand Experiences.

ApeFest is an annual event hosted by the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).
  It primarily attracts owners of digital goods known as NFTs, which are
  based on the cutting-edge blockchain technology also playing an
  important role at BMW. The BAYC is one of the most renowned NFT
  collections held by US firm Yuga Labs and comprises a total of 10,000
  unique digital collector's items depicting stylized ape motifs.
  ApeFest is aimed at a highly tech-savvy community of people fuelled by
  extraordinary creative energy and an insatiable thirst for innovation
  – making this an ideal match-up for the BMW brand. The community
  gathers at ApeFest to connect and shape the future of Web3 technology,
  to gain access to exclusive digital content and experiences, and to
  develop new business ideas.

BMW lined up as a partner of the event once again this year –
  and shone its Las Vegas spotlight on three key themes:

BMW, in collaboration with AirConsole and Bandai Namco, has
  developed the exclusive PAC-MAN Championship Edition* game for its
  vehicles. In this unique iteration, the iconic PAC-MAN sets out to
  collect cars such as a BMW M Baby Racer and a BMW XM Label, along with
  items from the BMW M Lifestyle Collection.

The game was premiered at ApeFest as an AirConsole experience in a
  BMW XM Label. With PAC-MAN celebrating the 45th anniversary of its
  classic debut, this ranks as a headline collaboration. The BMW XM
  Label, renowned for its blend of performance, extrovert character and
  technology, effectively becomes the stage for this legendary game.
  Following its launch at ApeFest, the PAC-MAN Championship Edition*
  will be made available across all suitably specified BMW models.

This roll-out allows players to fully immerse themselves in the world
  of PAC-MAN directly in their vehicle, highlighting a tangible link
  between vehicle technology, entertainment and digital innovation.

BMW already offers a range of games with AirConsole, providing a
  premium in-car entertainment experience. A key feature here is the use
  of smartphones as controllers; players simply scan a QR code on the
  vehicle's display to connect. The system creates a unique and seamless
  gaming experience, even supporting a multiplayer mode that allows up
  to seven people to play together, turning the car into a mobile arcade
  for the whole family.

Another focal point at ApeFest was the
  presentation of the new BMW M Collection, which has been customised by
  the company’s collaboration partner and carries Bored Ape Bimmer Club
  (BABC) branding.

The Collection was revealed as part of a live show fronted by
  animated 3D character “Max”, BMW’s very own digital ape. With a
  presentation big on charm and innovation, Max acted as a model
  bridging real-world fashion and digital experience.

QR codes transported visitors directly to the Collection’s product
  pages. The interplay of physical and digital elements created a new
  form of brand showcase – open, authentic and technologically on point.

BMW also made a statement with a live performance by the artist
  Pauser (@Pausrr), who turned 24 black BMW suitcases into large-format
  graffiti art. Each of the suitcases was designed individually and
  personalised with e.g. initials and personal symbols, making it a
  one-off collector’s item that was then sold.

The installation embodied the themes of identity, mobility and
  design. And the standalone individual pieces were arranged into a
  complex artwork that underscored once again the community-led
  character of the initiative.

BMW was also
  represented at the event by an exclusive VIP fleet of vehicles
  including the BMW XM Label and BMW X7. Another star of ApeFest was a
  strikingly styled BMW M3 from the BMW Performance Center USA
  (Thermal), which served as a content studio for creators, media and
  guests. The high-performance model became a hotspot for video, photos
  and interviews focusing on design, technology and lifestyle. This was
  a place where product experiences and digital communication overlapped.

The BMW presence in Las Vegas was designed as an open-ended brand
  platform – with zones for gaming, fashion, art and connecting. The
  result was a space emphasising interaction and the sharing of ideas
  over traditional product presentations. Classic cars from the regional
  BMW community – members from southern California showed off their
  pride and joy at AREA15 – provided a bridge between the past and the future.

By hooking up with ApeFest once again, BMW has strengthened its
  presence in a space that mixes technological and cultural trends – and
  provided another demonstration of how mobility, lifestyle and digital
  culture can engage and connect with one another.
