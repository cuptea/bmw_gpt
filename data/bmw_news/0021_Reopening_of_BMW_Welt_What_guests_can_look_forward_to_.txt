Following extensive renovation work, BMW Welt
  reopens its doors today and presents new highlights for an exciting
  brand experience. As part of the reopening, a major innovation is in
  the pipeline: The new BMW Welt app offers visitors an innovative
  experience by combining BMW Welt's offerings with virtual content.

“With the reopening of BMW Welt, our visitors can look forward to new
  worlds of experience and events. One of the highlights is the BMW Welt
  app, which will be available at the end of February and will allow
  visitors to discover our museum in a completely new, immersive way.
  Virtual tours, gamification and detailed information about our
  vehicles make it the ideal companion for a visit to BMW Welt. We have
  also made many technological and technical optimisations to improve
  existing attractions and offers,” says Sandra Wittemer, Head of BMW Welt.

The BMW Welt App, which will be available to download from the end of
  February, turns a tour of BMW Welt into an interactive and informative
  adventure. A virtual tour with 16 stations is available to guests. The
  BMW Welt app offers a digital AI avatar as a personal tour guide. The
  tour can be started at any time at the touch of a button, allowing
  visitors to freely determine both the starting point and the pace of
  their own tour. The international audience can also be guided through
  event areas and exhibits in two languages if required.

If a vehicle particularly catches your eye, the BMW Welt app offers
  the opportunity to marvel at it as a digital 360° model on your
  smartphone. All you need to do is activate the smartphone camera via
  the BMW Welt app and capture a QR code on the exhibit. If required,
  the corresponding data sheets with all vehicle specifications are
  available for download.

In addition to the new exploration functions of BMW Welt, the BMW
  Welt app also provides attractive offers and discounts for the shop,
  restaurants and car hire as well as other functions such as a quiz, a
  scavenger hunt and the MINI Arcade as part of a major raffle.

BMW Welt's reopening week also has a lot to offer beyond the app: In
  addition to its role as a photo point, the BMW Isetta on display will
  also be driven through BMW Welt several times a day to hand out free
  gingerbread hearts to all guests. And on Valentine's Day, the kiss cam
  in the red BMW X3 and the Valentine's photo backdrop in the MINI area
  will be available for couples to take photos together.

Much has been changed and renovated in the exhibition areas of BMW
  Welt. With the M Clubhouse, BMW M presents a new experience that
  combines the inviting character of a living room with the motorsport
  fascination of a BMW M garage. Highlights include the new BMW M5* in a
  unique design by artist Fillin Guas and a special sound installation
  that brings the Nürburgring to Munich.

In the newly designed BMW area, an interactive and informative space
  was created for the topics Charging, My BMW App and RELAX. WE CARE. In
  addition, UNO Car Party can be played with the whole family via AirConsole.

The BMW Welt Business Center has also been redesigned and will
  welcome guests from 18 February. Still bookable for conferences,
  meetings or similar events, elegant earth tones and golden accents in
  the fabrics and materials used create a modern look and an inviting ambience.

The reopening also marks the start of BMW Welt's event year. Due to
  high demand, the BMW Welt yoga programme will continue from 22
  February. From the children's music theatre “Frank and Bert” by the
  Bavarian State Opera on 2 March to the PULSE opening event on 8 March
  in the double cone and the planned start of this year's
  Internationales Krimifestival München on 4 April in BMW Welt, where
  Prof. Dr. Hendrik Streeck will read from his new business thriller
  “Das Institut”, there is already a lot on offer early in the year.

Fans of unusual sounds can expect something very special on 27 April:
  “Sound Journey on Four Wheels - A Children's Concert at BMW Welt”, a
  musical collaboration between the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra and
  BMW that focuses on the car.

Further highlights are already on the horizon for the rest of the
  year: the BMW Welt Campus will not only once again offer a holiday
  programme, but also the vr4kids road safety exercise. During this
  interactive 3D experience, children experience dangerous situations
  from everyday road traffic in a safe, digital environment and can
  train their behaviour accordingly. A new charging station for electric
  vehicles is also being built outside BMW Welt and will be officially
  unveiled in autumn.
