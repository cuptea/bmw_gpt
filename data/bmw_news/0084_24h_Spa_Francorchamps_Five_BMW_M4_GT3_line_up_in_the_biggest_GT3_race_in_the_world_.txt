At the wheel for ROWE Racing will be the regular drivers, who have
  already contested the first two races of this season’s Fanatec GT
  World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup. Sharing the driving duties in
  the #50 BMW M4 GT3 will be Juniors Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER)
  and Neil Verhagen (USA). This trio recently narrowly missed out on a
  podium, finishing fourth in Le Castellet (FRA). Nick Catsburg (NED),
  Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) start in the #98 car.
  Catsburg won the 24h Spa-Francorchamps in the BMW Z4 GT3 in 2015. ROWE
  Racing tasted success the following year with the BMW M6 GT3.

In 2018, Walkenhorst Motorsport took overall victory. This time, the
  team’s two BMW M4 GT3 start in the Gold and Bronze Cup classes. BMW M
  works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) is joined by Americans Michael
  Dinan, Robby Foley and Richard Heistand in the Gold Cup. In the Bronze
  Cup, which is exclusively for amateur drivers, team-principal Henry
  Walkenhorst will share the wheel with Jörg Breuer, Friedrich von
  Bohlen and Mario von Bohlen (all GER). In the Silver Cup, the ST
  Racing team is making its Spa debut. Sharing the #28 BMW M4 GT3 are
  Samantha Tan, Nick Wittmer (both CAN), Harry Gottsacker (USA) and
  Maxime Oosten (NED).

Throughout the whole weekend, BMW M Motorsport will display the new
  BMW M4 GT4, which will be in action around the world from the 2023
  season. Fans can also check out the “M Town” paddock area, while
  regular talks are held on the stage. The 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps
  starts at 16:45 on Saturday, 30

“Spa-Francorchamps is the next debut at one of the really big 24-hour
  classics for the new BMW M4 GT3. With a field of more than 60 GT3
  cars, this race is hugely challenging. BMW M Motorsport has an
  outstanding record at this classic and, in ROWE Racing and Walkenhorst
  Motorsport, the last two victorious BMW teams are both set to start.
  With the BMW M4 GT3, we are well positioned to back up the success of
  its predecessor. Since the Nürburgring 24 Hours, we have worked hard
  to make the car more stable and to keep improving it. We are confident
  that that work will pay dividends at Spa-Francorchamps.”

“We
  are very much looking forward to appearing in Spa again. This race is
  a major challenge for the teams and drivers, and a mega show for the
  fans. This year, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps once again has a
  top-class field. Our goal for the race is actually very simple: ROWE
  Racing aspires to finish on the podium in every 24-hour race. And we
  obviously also want to add to our unique record at this circuit. To do
  this, however, the reliability of our new BMW M4 GT3 must play ball,
  which is always a challenge in the first year with a new car. BMW M
  Motorsport and we have worked hard on this in recent weeks. As a team,
  we have prepared as meticulously and intensively for this race than
  ever before.”

“Every
  year, this race is one of my absolute favourites – I am obviously
  delighted with my overall victory in 2015. Together with Augusto
  Farfus and Nick Yelloly, we have a very fast and experienced trio of
  drivers in our car. The team has an impressive record, with Spa
  victories in cars from various manufacturers. With this in mind, we
  should have a good chance of competing at the very front. There have
  been a few changes to the circuit, which could be an issue in the
  race. I’m thinking of gravel on the track, for example. It will
  therefore be all the more important to avoid any trouble and drive a
  clean race. I can hardly wait.”

“We are
  really looking forward to our first 24-hour race with ROWE Racing and
  the big challenge at Spa-Francorchamps. Our last race in Le Castellet
  went well, with fourth place. At the recent 24h Portimão, where we
  tested the new BMW M4 GT4, we learned a lot more about good practice
  during a 24-hour race. Based on the impressions gained during the Spa
  test, we seem to have good race pace. We can definitely still improve
  a little in qualifying. I will also have my first outing in the
  simulator, in the Fanatec Esports GT Pro Series. I will try to perform
  well and possibly score a few points for the team.”

“We have a very strong package in the Gold Cup.
  Walkenhorst Motorsport has won the race in the past, and my US
  team-mates are all very fast. As such, our goal has to be to win our
  class. The BMW M4 GT3 has now completed many kilometres of racing, but
  the Spa-Francorchamps circuit will still be a real test over 24 hours.
  The pre-race test went very well for us, and we are confident heading
  into the weekend.”
