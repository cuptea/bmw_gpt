. BMW M is taking the digital customer
  experience to the next level. New in-car apps developed exclusively
  for BMW M customers deliver even greater excitement and enhance the
  driving experience for BMW M models and BMW M vehicles. Accessible via
  the central display, they provide additional, individually
  configurable digital BMW M views for increased personal value. The
  in-car apps “M Cockpit”, “M Drag Meter”, and “M Channel” are now
  available worldwide as part of the BMW Digital Premium Package for the
  new BMW iX3 with M Sport Package and M Sport Package Pro. In the
  future, customers of other BMW M models equipped with BMW Operating
  System X will also benefit from this new digital offering.

“The fascination with sporty and highly dynamic driving is what
  drives the BMW M brand,” says Sylvia Neubauer, Vice President for
  Brand, Customers, and Sales at BMW M GmbH. “Our new BMW M in-car apps
  give drivers even deeper insight into their vehicle and expand the
  range of possible uses. This makes the joy of driving even more
  tangible in everyday life.”

The “M Cockpit” in-car app provides BMW M drivers with comprehensive,
  real-time insights into their vehicle. It visualises a variety of
  values relating to driving dynamics, chassis, powertrain, and geodata,
  and offers a high level of customisation. Drivers can configure up to
  five dashboards for the central display, each showing real-time data
  tailored to their preferences.

Designed for use on drag strips, the “M Drag Meter” in-car app
  incorporates gamification elements and presents longitudinal dynamics
  data quickly and transparently. It displays specific acceleration and
  deceleration values as well as the driver’s reaction time when
  sprinting from standstill, directly on the central display.
  GPS-supported speed and distance measurements form the basis of this
  functionality. With extension customisation options, this integrated
  performance measurement tool can be tailored to individual
  requirements. Drivers can view up to four measurement criteria and
  their results simultaneously on the central display.

The BMW M in-car app “M Channel” provides entertainment for BMW M
  drivers and passengers during charging sessions or breaks. As the
  first BMW M in-car media channel, it offers a wide selection of
  high-quality, on-demand BMW M video content accessible via the central
  display. A preview section with video descriptions highlights the
  available content, which is presented with crystal-clear playback and
  immersive sound. The “M Channel” app features a broad range of how-to
  videos, stories, and motorsport content for M enthusiasts, as well as
  information on other BMW M offerings such as the BMW Driving Academy.

BMW M is further advancing its digital ecosystem with the integration
  of the BMW M Community into the My BMW App. BMW M customers gain
  access to exclusive benefits within the community, including unique
  products, special events, select partner offers, and premium BMW M
  content. Members can also connect directly with one another and
  exchange ideas. The integration aligns with the GEN M brand campaign,
  the emotional home for those who live motorsport and high performance.
  At launch, all BMW M drivers in Germany with M High Performance or M
  Performance vehicles from model year 2014 onward, provided they are
  connected to the My BMW App, will have access.
