. The all-electric MINI Countryman SE ALL4 is a
  reliable companion for exploring new paths. As a spacious crossover
  model, the versatile adventurer enables locally emission-free mobility
  on a wide variety of terrain. This is guaranteed by the powerful ALL4
  all-wheel drive, extended driving assistance functions, partially
  automated Level 2 driving and an electric range of up to 433
  kilometers according to the WLTP test cycle. *

The modern, minimalistic design with clearly designed surfaces and
  wider wheel arches reinforces the look of the MINI Countryman SE ALL4.
  In addition, the all-rounder has grown significantly and now measures
  4,433 mm in length, 1,843 mm in width and 1,656 mm in height. As a
  result, the currently largest MINI model offers new interior space.
  With a capacity of up to 1,450 liters, even bulky items can be easily
  transported when the bench is folded down.

“The new all-electric, all-wheel-drive MINI Countryman is the epitome
  of versatility and driving pleasure. It is the first MINI “Made in
  Germany” and makes a statement for environmentally friendly mobility.
  Thanks to its increased dimensions, it is a vehicle for the entire
  family,” says Stefanie Wurst, head of MINI.

Two powerful electric motors with a total
  output of 230 kW/313 hp and a torque of 494 Nm guide the MINI
  Countryman SE ALL4 through any terrain. Together, they accelerate the
  vehicle from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 180
  km/h. The powerful battery has an energy content of 66.45 kWh. *

With rapid charging with DC at up to 130 kW, just under 30 minutes
  are enough to charge the battery from 10 percent to 80 percent.
  Customers can optimize the charging process at any time through
  easy-to-understand settings and view them via the MINI app.

For a particularly pleasant start, charging can be completed by a
  fixed departure time and the vehicle interior can be air-conditioned
  to the desired temperature by then. For the first time, the new MINI
  Countryman SE ALL4 can be charged with the Plug & Charge system.
  This recognizes public charging stations without additional
  authorization and automatically starts the charging process at
  suitable charging stations.

Innovative assistance systems support the driver on the go. With the
  Driving Assistant Professional, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 enables
  partially automated Level 2 driving on motorway-like routes for the
  first time. This allows the driver to take his hands off the wheel at
  speeds of up to 60 km/h, as long as he continues to follow the traffic
  closely and remains ready to intervene at any time. In addition, the
  assistant can identify gaps in traffic necessary to change lanes to
  the exit. It then brings the vehicle to the optimum speed for assisted
  lane changes.

The design of the MINI Countryman SE ALL4
  underlines the character of the crossover model through the vertical
  orientation of the body details. The distinctive front grille, the
  distinctive headlights and the very sculptural bonnet underline the
  appearance. Short overhangs and slim contouring give the vehicle's
  silhouette an elegant definition.

The distinctive light-alloy wheels of the MINI Countryman SE ALL4,
  measuring up to 20-inch, are aerodynamically optimised, just like the
  entire body. As a result, the model achieves a drag coefficient of
  0.26, is more economical in consumption and has an increased range.
  The stylish design of the C-pillar with the model-specific ALL4 logo
  supports the extended roof line in the rear of the vehicle and makes
  it appear shorter at the same time. The rear section is particularly
  uniform with clear surfaces and flush rear lights. Its vertical
  orientation underlines the wider stand of the MINI Countryman SE ALL4.
  The MINI LED headlights and taillights support the distinctive
  appearance with new radiance through unique light signatures.

Four trim variants set individual accents and accentuate different
  vehicle features with stylish exterior and interior features. The MINI
  Countryman SE ALL4 has been expanded to include the new Vibrant Silver
  shade for the first time in the range of characteristic MINI
  contrasting roofs.

Advanced technology and high-quality materials in the interior. The
  focal point of the cockpit in the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 is the round
  OLED display. The central instrument with a diameter of 240 mm and a
  high-quality glass surface simultaneously controls the infotainment
  and assistance systems. With the new MINI Operating System 9, all
  vehicle functions can be operated intuitively via touch or voice assistant.

The MINI Experience Modes are available for particularly immersive
  driving experiences. In addition to specific graphic elements on the
  OLED display, MINI fans can experience the entire interior in a new
  way through special lighting graphics in different colors and
  patterns. In addition, the new MINI Driving Sounds in the all-electric
  MINI Countryman SE ALL4 create a unique ambiance.

In the new MINI Countryman SE ALL4, the driver and front passenger
  gain significantly in comfort with just under three centimetres of
  additional shoulder and elbow width. The seats in the rear are also
  increased by 2.5 centimetres shoulder width. Thanks to clear shapes
  and the dashboard with two-tone textile design, the cockpit looks
  modern and clear. With the panoramic glass roof, the interior looks
  particularly bright and friendly. The four redesigned trims convey the
  modern interior concept in various forms.

The most important driving functions are directly accessible via the
  redesigned toggle bar. This eliminates the need for the gear selector
  and creates space in the center console for practical storage options.
  For example, smartphones can be stored on a spacious storage area and
  charged at the same time via wireless charging.
