Summary:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1962, the British brand achieved its first international rally victory, thanks to the talent and passion of a modern-day heroine of racing: Pat Moss. The new MINI Pat Moss Edition for the MINI 3-door and        MINI 5-door is a tribute to a pioneer, MINI's sporting history and true team spirit. And strong women play a key role in shaping the success of the MINI brand today as well - these are their stories.

On International Women's Day 2022, MINI
  remembers a legendary female racing driver. Pat Moss made motorsport
  history in 1962, scoring the first international rally victory for the
  British brand on the prestigious Noordwijk - Monte Carlo - Noordwijk
  route, better known as the "International Tulip Rally". Her
  victory not only kicked off the Classic MINI's unique success story in
  rallying, but also caused a sensation in male-dominated racing.
  "Mossie" and "Wizz", as Pat Moss and her co-pilot
  Ann Wisdom were called in the racing scene, managed to create facts
  that nobody could ignore. At a time when gender roles were
  predetermined, these two women unceremoniously defined them
  themselves. 60 years later, society has taken some decisive steps
  forward. And more than ever, strong women at MINI are shaping the
  success and image of the British premium brand.

Stefanie Wurst has been in charge of the MINI brand since February
  2022. With her experience in holistic business management and her
  intercultural background, she is determined to electrify the British
  premium brand and strengthen the issue of sustainability. "It is
  the very idea of MINI to make economical use of resources and
  available space. The small ecological footprint is already in MINI's
  genes, so to speak. When it comes to sustainability, our customers
  need to know what we are doing and why, so that they can make a
  conscious decision," says Stefanie Wurst about her approach. For
  her, sustainable corporate governance also includes values such as
  diversity, tolerance and openness. "It's not about favouring
  certain groups, it's about building a modern team that reflects and
  understands the changing global communities well. A modern brand must
  be meaningful, positive and constantly evolving."

Jennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod is accompanying this realignment as Head
  of Communications for MINI and BMW Motorrad. For her, diversity and
  equal opportunities are part of MINI's recipe for success: "We
  clearly see diversity as a strength - both within and outside our
  organisation - the appropriate makeup of our teams in all areas is a
  key factor in the creativity, innovation and ultimately success of the
  MINI brand."

With her talent, courage and passion, Pat Moss in the Classic MINI
  left the male competition behind her - and many an established role
  model along as well. Now a special edition bears the name of the rally
  driver who died in 2008. The Pat Moss Edition for the MINI Cooper S
  3-door (combined fuel consumption: 6.6 – 6.2 l/100 km; combined CO2
  emissions: 151 – 140 g/km according to WLTP) and the MINI John Cooper
  Works (combined fuel consumption: 7.1 – 6.8 l/100 km; combined CO2
  emissions: 162 – 156 g/km WLTP) and the MINI Cooper S 5-door (combined
  fuel consumption: 6.8 – 6.2 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 154 -
  141 g/km according to WLTP) will arrive at dealers in May 2022 -
  exactly 60 years after its triumph in the Netherlands.

Its design reflects both the brand's racing tradition and the
  personal history of Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom, and also integrates MINI
  product innovations such as the Multitone Roof. "When there is
  already a strong story, as with the Pat Moss Edition, it is a pleasure
  to define the details, combine the elements that underline this story,
  choose the right colour combination and decide where to place the
  design features," says Morgane Bavagnoli, the MINI designer responsible.

Her own story at MINI began in 2010 with an internship in Munich,
  which she was thrilled with right from the start and which was to
  shape her career. Almost 10 years later and after working at
  Designworks and BMW, Morgane Bavagnoli returned to the MINI design
  team. Among other things, she was responsible for the colour concept
  of the MINI Electric Pacesetter. Most recently, for example, she also
  developed the design of the décor and interior surfaces for the MINI
  Countryman in the "Untamed Edition". Her heart beats for
  surprising details that even MINI fans may only notice at second
  glance. For example, the main symbol of the MINI Pat Moss Edition -
  the graphic of a tulip, which can be seen discreetly but unmistakably
  in many places. It is these special details with which designers like
  Morgane emphasise the individual character of a MINI and contribute to
  the success of the brand. "Being a designer at MINI is something
  special. The opportunity to get involved in completely different
  projects and work at different levels - from pre-development and
  research to concept cars and series implementation - is always
  refreshing," says Morgane Bavagnoli about her personal drive.

Telling stories like Pat Moss's is also Lina Fischer's passion. In
  the MINI Editorial Office, she works on editorial marketing and the
  MINI Insider magazine. She has been part of MINI since 2010. The
  editorial production around the Pat Moss Edition focused on female
  empowerment in several respects. A female photographer, an editor and
  two female drivers for the action scenes on the road worked together
  for the shoot and staged the edition, which was largely designed by
  women. "I am proud to have worked on this project together in a
  team with such strong and inspiring women," says Lina Fischer.

Verena Markart, Product Manager at MINI, also appreciates this kind
  of inspiration in her work. For her, the MINI community in particular
  is always a key driver in her work.  "Unconventional, versatile,
  creative and self-determined personalities, for whom community and new
  experiences are important, motivate me every day" For her, the
  rally victory commemorated by the Pat Moss Edition is linked to the
  attitude that still applies to MINI today: “Born to compete”. The
  motto rounds off the Quick Facts about the legendary Tulip Rally,
  which are listed below the side scuttles on the front side walls: from
  the route Noordwijk - Monte Carlo - Noordwijk, to the distance of
  2,500 kilometres and the vehicle, the Mini Cooper, to its starting
  number 104.

"MINI stands for thinking things differently, and that's what I
  love about our brand," says Yvonne Schrader, who heads up brand
  management, communications management and artwork at MINI. "I
  associate Pat Moss' success above all with the motto "Only MINI
  can do", turning dreams into action. Mossie" and
  "Wizz" already had this mindset. They dared to do the
  extraordinary instead of just talking about it."

With British understatement, co-driver Ann Wisdom later recalled the
  success in the Classic MINI: "We didn't see ourselves as pioneers
  back then, we simply drove a rally." The MINI team firmly
  believes that diversity is a strength. A team of players with
  different backgrounds and personalities is crucial - friction is where
  new ideas, solutions, products and services for the MINI brand are
  continuously created.
