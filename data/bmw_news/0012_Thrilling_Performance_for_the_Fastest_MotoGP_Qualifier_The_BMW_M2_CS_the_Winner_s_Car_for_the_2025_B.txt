Assen. It’s a moment the entire MotoGP™ family eagerly anticipates
  each year: the unveiling of the winner’s car for the BMW M Award. That
  moment arrived at the Grand Prix of the Netherlands at Assen.
  Representing all MotoGP™ riders, Brad Binder and Alex Rins revealed
  the prize that awaits the fastest qualifier of the season: the new BMW
  M2 CS (fuel consumption combined: 10.0 l/100 km; CO₂ emissions
  combined: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO₂ class: G)* in Velvet Blue Metallic.

The BMW M Award has been a cornerstone of BMW M’s activities as the
  ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’ and has been presented annually since 2003.
  In every MotoGP™ qualifying session, points are awarded based on
  position – mirroring the race points system. The rider with the most
  points at the end of the season’s final qualifying session wins the
  coveted prize: an exclusive high-performance BMW M automobile.

The 2025 winner’s car, the BMW M2 CS, was introduced to the world at
  the end of May. It raises the bar for pure driving pleasure in the
  premium compact high-performance sports car segment. This latest
  exclusive special edition from BMW M GmbH thrills with outstanding
  agility, significantly increased power, exceptional driving dynamics,
  and distinctly sporty design features. The inline six-cylinder engine
  with M TwinPower Turbo technology and high-revving characteristics in
  the BMW M2 CS delivers an impressive 390 kW (530 hp). Power is
  transmitted to the rear wheels via the standard 8-speed M Steptronic
  transmission with Drivelogic. The BMW M2 CS accelerates from 0 to 100
  km/h in just 3.8 seconds.

BMW M GmbH has reduced the special model’s weight by around 30
  kilogrammes compared to the base model, thanks to targeted lightweight
  construction using numerous exterior and interior components made of
  carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP). It comes equipped with forged
  M light-alloy wheels as standard. This makes the BMW M2 CS the
  lightest BMW M2 of the current generation.

Binder and Rins had the opportunity to get a closer look at the new
  winner’s car during a special competition at Assen. This time, it
  wasn’t only about outright speed on the racetrack – it was all about
  skill, handling, and, of course, speed. In a Drive in Reverse
  Challenge, the two MotoGP™ aces had to complete a marked course in
  reverse gear as quickly as possible. Touching one of the marker cones
  incurred a two-second time penalty. Meanwhile, the other rider took on
  the role of commentator and gave live play-by-play of the “race.” The
  winner was Binder.

The BMW M2 CS in Velvet Blue Metallic will be handed over to the 2025
  BMW M Award winner at the season finale in mid-November at Valencia,
  Spain. Record winner Marc Márquez claimed the award seven times in a
  row from 2013 to 2019. In the past three years, Francesco Bagnaia has
  secured the coveted prize. The list of winners also includes Valentino
  Rossi, Casey Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo, Fabio Quartararo, Sete Gibernau,
  and Nicky Hayden.
