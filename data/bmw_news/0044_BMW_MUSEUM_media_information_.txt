The BMW Museum in Munich takes its visitors on an impressive
  journey through more than 100 years of car and motorcycle history
  shaped by wonderment, innovation, dynamism and the joy of the open
  road on two wheels and four. It charts a course from the early days to
  the present day, and in so doing paints a comprehensive picture of the
  BMW brand’s talent for innovation. Good news about the Museum has
  travelled fast: with over 840,000 visitors in the past year, it is one
  of Munich’s most popular. The BMW Museum is part of BMW Group Classic
  – the wing of the company charged with nurturing the history of BMW
  and everything that involves.

BMW has always demonstrated a keen awareness of its history. A
  factory museum was opened at the Munich plant back in 1966, and in the
  late 1960s the BMW Board of Management decided to build a museum to
  reflect the company as a whole. Viennese architect Karl Schwanzer won
  the competition to design the building, and the Museum was duly
  created according to his plans. His was the inspiration behind the
  Rotunda, also known informally as the “Bowl” on account of its
  distinctive appearance. The Museum concept was presented in 1973 under
  the heading “Streets and urban squares in the renovated exhibition
  space”. A central ramp within the Rotunda connects a system of
  apparently floating platforms.

Design firm Atelier Brückner took the concept to the next stage with
  the renovation and expansion of the Museum from 2004 to 2008, since
  when the low-rise section of the building has been part of the overall
  complex together with the “Bowl”. “Bridges and houses” have been added
  to the architectural concept, which has expanded the surface area of
  the Museum to five times its original size. A system of ramps shapes
  the inner structure of the Museum. It reaches dynamically into the
  space and appears to be almost weightless. The modern facades of the
  seven exhibition houses, unusual lines of sight through the interior,
  asphalt floors and upward-spiralling pathways through the exhibition
  areas create a lively urban setting.

The permanent exhibition represents the core of the BMW Museum and
  takes visitors on a themed journey from the past into the future. The
  route leads guests through seven exhibition houses. The “House of
  Design” is all about the design process and charts the progression
  from idea brainstorming to style-defining product; the “House of the
  Company” explores the history and company culture of BMW; and the
  “House of the Motorcycle” studies the development of motorcycle design
  and engineering at BMW. The “House of Technology” displays the
  technical innovations BMW has employed to meet the evergrowing demands
  of car and motorcycle design. In the “House of Motorsport”, the
  history of BMW in race competition commands the spotlight. Here, we
  showcase the full spectrum of technical possibilities, turned into
  reality with no effort or endeavour spared.

The “House of the Series” details the development of individual model
  ranges, such as the BMW 5 Series. BMW’s lines of communication with
  the people who use its vehicles is the theme for the “House of the
  Brand”, which looks at customers’ personal experiences with BMW cars.
  This house also examines the subject of sustainability at BMW. In
  addition, the temporary exhibitions in the “Bowl” each have their own
  theme and are dedicated to particular subject areas at the company.
  Examples have included the BMW i brand and the overall sphere of
  electric mobility. Since the BMW Museum re-opened in 2008, it has used
  special exhibitions like these to present topics in which the BMW
  brand is deeply engaged.

The hour-long guided tour through the permanent exhibition gives
  visitors the chance to immerse themselves in the Museum’s wealth of
  exhibits and gain some fascinating background insights into the
  development of the BMW brand. The tours are led by recognised experts,
  who are more than happy to incorporate specific topics or areas of
  interest on request. The BMW Museum can also be explored digitally via
  accompanying content on smartphones or tablets. Here, visitors can
  find out more about the history of the BMW brand and have a lot of fun
  in the process. The BMW Museum uses cashless purchase options only –
  i.e. credit card, contactless methods or mobile wallet – for entry
  tickets, Museum tours and souvenirs. Entry tickets can be paid for
  online, using the ticket payment machines or at the cash desk. Guided
  tours, kids’ birthday parties and school holiday activities can also
  be booked online – up to six months in advance.

The BMW Junior Museum is designed specifically for younger guests.
  The BMW Junior Museum programme invites children and teenagers on a
  journey of discovery through the world of mobility and is available
  all year round. Workshops designed for the age group at hand allow
  young visitors to delve into interesting topics from different angles.
  The workshops feature fascinating content on topics such as design,
  architecture, art and sustainability, and fuel the creativity of the
  kids. The tour through the BMW Museum included as part of the
  workshops is designed to respond to the youngsters’ interests and meet
  their needs. Interactive elements allow them to explore mobility from
  a variety of perspectives and cast an eye over more than 100 years of
  car and motorcycle history. The workshops are held in German and
  English. The programme offered by the BMW Museum reflects its vision
  of an extracurricular place of learning for interdisciplinary
  educational experiences. The main objective of the BMW Museum’s
  educational offering is to encourage active engagement with the
  exhibits on display. The various workshops are geared to preschool,
  primary-school and secondaryschool children respectively.

The following workshops are offered at the BMW Junior Museum for
  groups and school classes:

These workshops can also be held as birthday celebration events,
  which include the option of either bringing your own food or booking
  refreshments from renowned caterers Feinkost Käfer. Several times a
  year, the BMW Museum also adds a Family Sunday with its own particular
  motto to the calendar. Here, the Museum lays on a wide range of
  attractions, such as arts & crafts, face painting and much more
  besides, and also invites guests to visit the exhibition areas of the
  BMW Museum. Along the way, the kids explore topics around mobility,
  design and sustainability. As part of its special school holiday
  programme, the Museum now also allows places to be booked individually
  for the Design Workshop held on every Thursday of the holidays. Here,
  children aged between 7 and 13 can develop their own vehicle designs
  under the guidance of our experts and with special tools.
