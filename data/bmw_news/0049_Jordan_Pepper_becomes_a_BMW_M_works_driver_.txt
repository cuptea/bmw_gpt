Pepper boasts numerous successes in GT racing. In 2025, he triumphed
  at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) and fought for the DTM
  title until the final race in his first full season. In the GT World
  Challenge Europe Sprint Cup, he finished second in the drivers’
  standings, just behind the Team WRT duo of Kelvin van der Linde and
  Charles Weerts (BEL). He achieved the same result in the Endurance Cup
  in 2024. Further big successes to date include winning the GTD-PRO
  class at the IMSA finale Petit Le Mans in 2024, victory at the
  Bathurst 12 Hour in 2020, and becoming the GT World Challenge America
  champion in 2021. In 2014, he won the overall title in the Volkswagen
  Scirocco R Cup Germany.

“In the
  coming season, we will once again undertake a very extensive racing
  programme with our BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Our goal is always to compete at
  the highest level in the best GT racing series in the world and fight
  for victories and titles. To achieve this, we need a driver line-up
  that is both large and of the highest quality. Jordan Pepper fits our
  requirements perfectly. Over the years, he has established himself as
  one of the top GT3 drivers. His performances, especially in the past
  two seasons, have been impressive. I am very pleased to welcome him to
  the BMW M Motorsport family and look forward to many shared successes
  in the future.”

: “It’s very exciting to begin a new
  chapter of my career with BMW M Motorsport. In South Africa, BMW is a
  very prestigious brand that I grew up with and always admired. My path
  into professional racing in Europe, however, took me through other
  manufacturers. Now I have the opportunity to drive for BMW M
  Motorsport, and I’m extremely excited about it. Over the years, I’ve
  seen how strong they are as competitors, and now I’m looking forward
  to driving the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for the first time. I know that adapting
  to a new car is always a challenge, and I’ll need to get used to the
  car over the winter but I generally like this type of car, as I’ve
  spent much of my career in similar cars. I can’t wait to work with all
  the great drivers at BMW M Motorsport – including, of course, Sheldon
  and Kelvin van der Linde. We’ve known each other since we were kids
  and are good friends. We’ve always dreamed of winning races together.
  Now we’re with the same manufacturer, and hopefully, we’ll get the
  chance to make that dream come true someday.”
