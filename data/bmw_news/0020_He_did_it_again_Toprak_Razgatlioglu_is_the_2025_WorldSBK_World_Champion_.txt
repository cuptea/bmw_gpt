After his outstanding championship win in 2024, Razgatlioglu entered
  the 2025 season as the clear favourite. However, following a winter
  testing phase during which the BMW M 1000 RR had to be adapted at
  short notice due to regulation changes, the season started off more
  challenging than expected. Despite scoring a hat-trick at the second
  round in Portimão (POR), there were also setbacks, and Razgatlioglu
  found himself in the role of the chaser behind Ducati rider Nicolò
  Bulega (ITA).

But by mid-season in June, ‘El Turco’, BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and
  the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team turned the tide. In Misano (ITA),
  Donington Park (GBR), the new Balaton Park Circuit (HUN), and
  Magny-Cours (FRA), he won every race – achieving four consecutive
  hat-tricks and taking the championship lead. He then celebrated his
  first-ever victory at MotorLand Aragón (ESP), equaling his own record
  from 2024 of 13 consecutive wins. After further victories and podium
  finishes, he ultimately secured the 2025 title with 616 points – 13
  points ahead of Bulega.

Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) wrapped up his final weekend as a
  WorldSBK rider with more strong Top 10 finishes. After five years with
  the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (2021–2025), he will remain part
  of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family. Already on Tuesday in Jerez de
  la Frontera, he will be back on the BMW M 1000 RR, working with the
  BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team to prepare for the 2026 WorldSBK season.

“Congratulations
  to Toprak and the entire team! This season, everyone has shown what
  true champions are made of. The first races weren’t easy, but for
  everyone – especially for Toprak – the attitude was clear: stand up,
  straighten your crown, and keep going. And what a way they kept going!
  The winning streak that began in Misano was simply breathtaking. Even
  on the nerve-racking final Sunday here in Jerez, after the unfortunate
  retirement in the Superpole Race through no fault of his own, everyone
  stayed completely focused and prepared everything perfectly so that
  Toprak could seal the deal in race two. The reward is Toprak’s
  well-deserved second World Championship title on our BMW M 1000 RR. We
  are incredibly proud of him and of everyone in the team, in Munich and
  Berlin, whose hard work made this achievement possible.”

“I am very happy and smiling. To get the title was very
  important for me. This was my last year with BMW and in the Superbike
  Paddock. It is a great gift to BMW before I leave for MotoGP. In the
  end we are World Champions. At the beginning of the season, we were
  not so strong but we improved with every race. Thanks to the entire
  team and BMW for all this hard work. It is not me being the World
  Champion, it is us. Looking back onto this final weekend: Everything
  went very well yesterday especially and today I came to the track more
  relaxed. I just needed to finish the Superpole Race within the top
  seven but we crashed in turn five. I know this is racing and everybody
  wants to pass. It is that he (Nicolò Bulega) just hit me and I
  crashed. After that I just stayed calm and focused on race two because
  I needed to do a good job there. I just focused on achieving the best
  possible position. I started the race not pushing too hard but I
  worked my way to the front step by step and in the end, we were on the
  podium. To be World Champion again is a great feeling and I want to
  thank everyone who was part of this journey.”

“I am
  very happy – and speechless. It is such a great day. I think that
  after the Superpole Race, we all aged by ten years. The job the team
  did was amazing. The bike was pretty damaged and to work under that
  pressure to get it ready for race two was incredible. Everybody stayed
  calm, and I think this was in the end the key for us to win the title.
  The second title in a row – we are happy for Toprak, for the team, for
  BMW Motorrad. Toprak wrote history for BMW. It was wild ride together
  and we are sad that it’s over but we will cheer for him next year. And
  we are also so thankful for everything that Mickey has done for us. We
  had difficult years, also with injuries but he was always loyal to us.
  And he has played an important part in winning these two title in both
  years. We are really looking forward to continue working with him.
  What we are going to do, we will announce soon. But for now – we are
  going to have a big party tonight, and from tomorrow on we fully focus
  on the 2026 WorldSBK season with Danilo Petrucci and Miguel Oliveira.”

“I can‘t describe how I feel because it was an
  incredible day. A few hours with a lot of emotions, ups and downs,
  everything happened. But at the end for sure to see Toprak back on the
  podium, celebrating the second world championship for us, for BMW,
  makes me very proud and the whole project, the whole team, everybody
  involved. So it’s a fantastic day to complete a fantastic. At the end
  the key for any success in sport is always focus and teamwork. We
  listened to the riders, we looked into our package and tried to be
  focused to learn from the situation when we were not fast enough to
  beat our competitors. And with the focus of the riders, of the crew
  and all our technicians in Munich, we managed to turn the page. Thank
  you to Toprak, who is an incredible person on and off the track, thank
  you to Mickey, who did so much for us since he joined in 2021, and
  thank you to the entire team! A very personal thank-you also goes to
  my wife Katharina and my kids, who are always a source of support for me.”

“My feelings are really tough to put into words. We
  woke up feeling super, super positive, but as we always know anything
  can happen in racing and it actually did in the sprint race. I’ve just
  got to put my hands together and praise the good work the guys did.
  The entire team stayed focused. In the end Toprak is a three-times
  World Champion, and two times with BMW. I am absolutely over the moon,
  proud as you can be, of everyone involved and the lot of hard work
  everybody did.

“It has been a nice weekend. I have for sure some mixed
  feelings about my races, especially race two I didn’t enjoy as much as
  I wish I did. But you know it’s racing and I think after today we have
  a lot of things to be happy about with the team. It has been a strange
  season. The start of the season was a bit weird with the last minute
  changes in regulations and stuff like that. Especially my side, I
  struggled quite a lot with the bike honestly. Also at one point,
  mentally it was difficult and I just could not find any progress. That
  has been tough. But we always kept working, the team always kept
  working and I think towards the end of the year I did the Suzuka 8
  Hours, got my confidence back and then when I came back I had the
  speed again and I felt more confident with the bike. I think Toprak
  showed again how special he is and he so deserves the title. He and
  the entire team deserve the title. Time went fast, and I enjoyed my
  time in WorldSBK. I have six wins here and podiums. Now I have exactly
  one day off and on Tuesday I will start with the test team to improve
  the package for next year for Danilo and Miguel.”
