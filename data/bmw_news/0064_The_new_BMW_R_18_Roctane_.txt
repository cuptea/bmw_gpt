The new R 18 Roctane joins the R 18, R 18 Classic, R 18 B and R 18
  Transcontinental as the fifth member of the R 18 family. Once again,
  it harks back to the history and tradition of BMW Motorrad and
  combines state-of-the-art motorcycle technology with the design and
  charm of times gone by.

Both technically and visually, the BMW R 18 borrows from famous
  BMW models such as the BMW R 5 and puts the focus back on the
  essentials of motorcycling: Purist, no-frills technology and the boxer
  engine as the epicentre of riding pleasure. Classic design and clear,
  yet contemporary technology merge to form a fascinating overall
  concept. This combination delivers a unique emotional riding
  experience and the model is characterised by skilfully staged design
  language with a rear section in so-called “streamlining design”.

The heart of the new BMW R 18 Roctane is the familiar 2-cylinder flat
  twin engine, the “big boxer”. Not only thanks to its impressive looks,
  but also its technical specifications, the engine of the new R 18
  Roctane, finished in Avus black metallic matt and with black
  high-gloss covers, harks back to the traditional air-cooled boxer
  engines that have provided an exhilarating riding experience for more
  than seven decades since BMW Motorrad began manufacturing motorcycles
  in 1923. The most powerful 2-cylinder boxer engine ever built in
  motorcycle series production boasts an engine capacity of 1,802 cc. It
  generates an output of 67 kW (91 hp) at 4,750 rpm. In the 2,000 to
  4,000 rpm range, it delivers more than 150 Nm of torque at all times
  as well as elemental pulling power and sonorous sound. The black
  engine is perfectly matched by the dark chrome exhaust system and the
  star counter nuts.

A double-loop tubular steel frame is at the heart of the chassis of
  the new R 18 Roctane. Its design perpetuates the longstanding BMW
  Motorrad tradition of this frame type. The particularly high
  manufacturing quality and attention to detail are also evident in
  barely perceptible details such as the welded joints between steel
  tubes and cast or forged parts. Like the legendary BMW R 5, the rear
  swinging arm, which is manufactured in a similar design, encloses the
  rear axle drive in the same style using bolted connections.

The suspension elements of the new BMW R 18 Roctane deliberately
  feature no electronic adjustment options. Instead, telescopic forks
  and a directly linked central sprint strut with travel-dependent
  damping and adjustable spring preload ensure superior wheel guidance
  and responsive suspension comfort. As in the legendary BMW R 5, the
  fixed tubes of the telescopic forks are encased in fork sleeves. The
  fixed fork tube diameter is 49 mm, suspension travel is 120 mm at the
  front and 90 mm at the rear. The new BMW R 18 Roctance is decelerated
  by a twin disc brake at the front and a single disc brake at the rear
  in conjunction with four-piston fixed calipers. The alloy wheels give
  the bike a stylish look. 3.5 x 21" at the front with 120/70 B 21
  tyres as and 5.5 x 18" at the rear with 180/55 B 18 tyres.

The new BMW R 18 Roctance features a casual, so-called “mid-mounted
  footpeg” position of the footrests, entirely in keeping with the BMW
  Motorrad philosophy. This classic position behind the cylinders is not
  only typical of BMW, it also allows a relaxed and active riding
  position for optimally controlling the motorcycle. The R 18 Roctane
  features a two-level seat that tapers slimly towards the rear, with
  rear passenger straps, and is equipped with running boards in
  conjunction with a gearshift paddle. The high, black-coated handlebars
  ensure an upright and relaxed riding position.

The new R 18 Roctane is ideally equipped for laid-back cruising and
  touring thanks to cases painted in the colour of the bike. The cases
  offer 27 litres of luggage space each. For longer tours, the new R 18
  Roctane can be equipped with a windshield with auxiliary headlights
  and suspended turn indicator lights from the Original BMW Motorrad
  Accessories range.

Three riding modes as well as ASC and engine drag control are
  standard equipment and ensure high-level riding fun and safety.
   Reversing aid, Hillstart Control and heated grips are available as
  optional equipment ex factory.

In order to meet individual customer needs, the new R 18 Roctane
  also features the three riding modes “Rain”, “Roll” and “Rock” as
  standard, which is unusual in this segment. The standard equipment
  also includes ASC (Automatic Stability Control), which ensures a high
  level of riding safety. In addition, the new R 18 Roctane is equipped
  with engine drag torque control as standard. In addition to other
  options, a reversing aid makes manoeuvring a comfortable affair and
  the Hill Start Control function makes starting off uphill easy. The
  heated grips, which are also available as optional equipment ex
  factory, keep your hands warm on cold days.

The R 18 Roctane skilfully reinterprets the iconic styling of past
  eras in custom bagger style and many details reflect the purist design
  that was primarily shaped by classics such as the BMW R 5. Functional
  and style-defining elements such as the double-loop tube frame, the
  pear-drop fuel tank or the open propeller shaft drive are reminiscent
  of the legendary 1936 boxer. The classic body parts of the R 18
  Roctane, such as the fuel tank, front and rear wheel covers or
  headlight housing, are also made of metal - just as befits an
  authentic classic. The suspension is likewise aptly reminiscent of the
  legendary R 5. Together with the double-sided swinging arm and a
  cantilever suspension strut, the rigid frame layout of the R 5 has
  been perfectly transferred to modern times.

Wherever the eye wanders, lovingly designed technology can be
  seen in every detail. This also applies to the headlight with the
  integrated, classically designed round instrument. The legendary BMW R
  5 from 1936 and from then on almost all BMW motorcycles until the
  early 1970s featured this characteristic combination. The new BMW R 18
  Roctane now revives this tradition - with state-of-the-art technology
  but contemporary design. The “BERLIN BUILT” lettering on the dial is a
  reference to the bike’s origin. The new R 18 Roctane is also
  manufactured at the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin-Spandau.

Like all other R 18 family members, the new R 18 Roctane offers a
  very conversion-friendly architecture, which was already the focus
  when the basic design of the R 18 series was being conceived. In
  addition the visible valve covers (cylinder head covers) and the chest
  cover (engine housing cover) are designed in such a way that they are
  located outside the oil chamber, making them very easy to change.
