As part of the BMW ART MAKERS
  programme, the artist Mustapha Azeroual and the curator Marjolaine
  Lévy are developing their project ‘The Green Ray’. This artistic
  project is a new experiment resulting from their collaboration and
  will culminate in an original, immersive exhibition designed
  specifically to be shown at the Cloister of Saint-Trophime during the
  Rencontres d'Arles. The exhibition will be redesigned for Paris Photo
  at the Grand Palais, Paris.

This is the ambition of ‘The Green Ray’, which is
  an extension of Mustapha Azeroual's photographic practice, the core of
  which is the production of abstract images that seek to give form to
  light and colour. These unique, unpublished images, presented at the
  Rencontres d'Arles, illustrate a protocol that began with recording
  the colour of the sky at sunrise and sunset on the high seas, in the
  Arctic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, and in the Mediterranean Sea -
  territories that Mustapha Azeroual had never explored before.

The artist didn't have to travel at all, thanks to a close
  collaboration with sailors and navigators, who had to follow a strict
  shooting protocol. The sailing communities that Mustapha Azeroual
  consulted are diverse, including private sailors and the ship Le Ponant.

Mustapha Azeroual then chose the most appropriate colours to create
  abstractions and reproduced them on lenticular supports. Lenticular
  printing makes it possible to create visual effects on a still image,
  such as relief or movement. The artist's abstract images, as rich and
  varied as they are, subtly show the influence of human activity and
  climatic phenomena. In fact, the colour of the sky, even on the high
  seas, is inextricably linked to these phenomena. Sensitive, poetic,
  and accessible at the same time, these exceptionally colourful images
  offer a glimpse into the transformation of the world.

For the Rencontres d'Arles, in the cloister
  of Saint-Trophime, visitors are invited to enter an airlock, to
  accustom their retinas to the play of colours, and then to plunge
  headlong into colour, to see these abstract gradations through an
  immersive installation in the form of two lenticular panopticons over
  4 metres high. The installation created for ‘The Green Ray’ is unique
  in that lenticular works have never been produced on such a monumental scale.

Marjolaine Lévy refers to the art historian Alexander Alberro, who
  believes that “the more works engage the viewer's nervous system, the
  more egalitarian they are”. All viewers will have their retinas
  stimulated and activated by the installation. With this exhibition,
  the winning duo will contribute to an experience that engages the
  viewer's senses above and beyond their knowledge of art.

To encourage contemplation, the exhibition furniture has been
  specially made from bio-based and recyclable materials in
  collaboration with the design department of the BMW Group Research and
  Development Centre in Munich.

‘The Green Ray’ is part of the BMW Group's environmental strategy,
  which aims to reduce the impact of its activities; by delegating
  photography to communities of sailors to limit travel, working closely
  with BMW Group designers on recyclable furniture and designing
  sceneographic structures that can be reused in future exhibitions.

This completely new installation fits perfectly with the themes of
  innovation and commitment promoted by the BMW ART MAKERS programme.

: “We are
  delighted to be the winners of the BMW Art Makers programme, both
  because it's a project that combines our shared reflections on
  narrative abstraction and because it's also an exhibition based on a
  close collaboration between artist and curator, which is quite rare,
  from the writing of the project to its production. Finally, the BMW
  ART MAKERS programme, with its focus on contemporary environmental and
  social issues, is the ideal context for us to bring our project ‘The
  Green Ray’ to a successful conclusion, an installation that is firmly
  rooted in the issues of our time and offers the public a unique
  immersive experience”.

For the BMW ART MAKERS programme, BMW Group France is offering a
  grant of €10,000 for the artist and €8,000 for the curator, a research
  and production budget of €15,000, as well as a solo exhibition at the
  Rencontres d'Arles and Paris Photo and an adapted display at Art Basel
  Paris and Les Voiles de Saint Tropez, of which BMW is an official partner.

"This programme highlights the complementarity of each
  individual to create a large-scale collective project, from the
  initial idea to the final work. Thanks to the BMW ART MAKERS
  programme, Mustapha Azeroual is able to experiment and create
  lenticular works on a scale never achieved. Marjolaine Lévy
  accompanies him as he scales up, designing a reinvented immersive
  space for each exhibition venue," said

Supporting the arts for more than 50 years, BMW is delighted to
  present ‘The Green Ray’ by Mustapha Azeroual and Marjolaine Lévy,
  artist-curator duo and winners of the BMW ART MAKERS, at the Cloister
  of Saint-Trophime, Arles.

Official partner of Les Rencontres d'Arles since 2010, BMW supports
  the festival’s influence, the dissemination of the art and
  contemporary creation. BMW France is providing a fleet of electric
  cars to transport VIPs and guests during the opening week.
