The BMW Group, together with its partners,
  has won the globally renowned JEC Composites Innovation Award for
  series-production exterior components in automobiles. The award was
  presented at the JEC World Premiere in Paris and recognizes
  innovations in the development of sustainable materials for the
  automotive industry.

In June of 2025, the BMW Group first announced the use of natural
  composites made from flax fibre in the design of series-production
  vehicles. The award in the "Automotive & Road Transportation
  Parts" category recognizes BMW Group’s successful integration of
  these innovative materials. BMW Group’s decision to use natural fibre
  composites for visible components in series-production vehicles is the
  most comprehensive application within the industry to date.

The innovative use of fibre composites is the result of years of
  research and development work and intensive cooperation with partners
  Bcomp Ltd., Cobra Advanced Composites Co. Ltd. and PPG Wörwag Coatings
  GmbH & Co. KG. Together, the consortium succeeded in overcoming a
  major technical challenge: ensuring the natural fibre composites
  developed would meet the complex requirements for series production
  required across the structure of the vehicle, including the high
  quality needed for the roof panel.

The use of natural fibres helps to reduce the CO₂e footprint of
  future vehicle models and has an impact on lightweight construction
  goals. Material tests show that superior exterior and interior
  components can be manufactured from these natural fibres.

A concrete example is the use of natural flax fibre composites
  instead of carbon fibre composites in the roof panels of future
  models. Replacing carbon roof panel with flax fibre panels can achieve
  a reduction in CO₂e emissions of around 40% during production plus
  addition end-of-life considerations.

The development of innovative natural flax fibre composites is the
  result of successful and intensive collaboration with internal and
  external partners. Cross-departmental and cross-company cooperation
  has led to new and innovative solutions in materials and manufacturing
  processes. Through BMW Group’s use of interdisciplinary expertise, it
  has been possible to develop forward-looking products and consistently
  promote sustainability in automotive engineering.

Dr. Herbert Negele, Head of Materials Development and Lightweight
  Construction, emphasized the importance of BMW Group’s collaborative
  approach: "At BMW Group, we are committed to thinking and acting
  responsibly. This premise requires the continuous development of our
  materials towards sustainability, while continuing to meet the high
  demands of functionality, lightweight construction and design. The JEC
  Award confirms our approach and motivates everyone involved in the
  project to continue along this path.”
