Following the successful completion of the "Class of
  2025," which included Berkay Besler (TUR), Nerea Martí (ESP),
  Matt Million (USA), and Niels Tröger (GER), the two-day screening of
  candidates for the second season of the BMW M Racing Academy took
  place at the end of October. Twelve young talents, aiming to drive the
  BMW M4 GT4 in the upcoming customer racing season, were selected from
  a large pool of applicants to face various challenges in Munich under
  the watchful eyes of BMW M Motorsport officials. They underwent
  practical driving contests in BMW M models guided by the BMW M Driving
  Experience, mental and fitness tests conducted by Formula Medicine
  experts, an Esports challenge on the racing simulator, as well as
  driver and media interviews.

The candidates' performances
  were observed and evaluated not only by experts from the respective
  fields but also by the three mentors of the BMW M Racing Academy – BMW
  M works drivers Jens Klingmann, Max Hesse (both GER), and Robby Foley
  (USA). This trio had already served as advisors during the "Class
  of 2025," providing valuable insights into the work of
  professional racing drivers. Klingmann, Hesse, and Foley will
  intensify their roles in 2026.

Three drivers from three
  continents were selected for the "Class of 2026."
  Representing Germany is Thomas Rackl. The 17-year-old competed for the
  ME Motorsport Team in the ADAC GT4 Germany over the past two seasons.
  In 2025, he finished seventh overall and fifth in the junior standings
  in the BMW M4 GT4 EVO alongside Linus Hahne (GER). In 2023, he secured
  second place in the German Kart Championship.

From the
  USA, Josh Green joins the programme. The 23-year-old excelled in his
  first full GT season in 2025, driving the BMW M4 GT4 EVO for Random
  Vandals Racing in GT4 America. Partnering with Sam Craven (USA), he
  claimed the Pro-Am category title with five wins and nine podium
  finishes.

Ryder Quinn is the first Australian member of
  the BMW M Racing Academy. The 20-year-old competed in the GT4
  Australia in 2025 with the BMW M4 GT4, finishing fourth overall in the
  Silver-Am category alongside Steve Jakic (AUS). The duo achieved one
  victory. In 2023, Quinn was a Michelin Junior in the Australian
  Porsche Carrera Cup, and in 2021, he became the Formula Ford
  Champion.

The programme for the BMW M Racing Academy
  "Class of 2026" will be announced at a later date.

"We are entering our second season with the
  BMW M Racing Academy, and I am very proud of the programme we launched
  in 2025. The focus is clearly on the academy concept. Our 'Class of
  2026' now has the unique opportunity to spend a year gaining insights
  into the work of BMW M Motorsport, which can significantly advance
  their own racing careers. Our three BMW M works drivers Jens
  Klingmann, Max Hesse, and Robby Foley are perfectly suited as mentors
  with their open-minded approach. The participants can learn an
  incredible amount from them. I am very much looking forward to the
  coming year."

"All twelve candidates who participated in the
  selection process can be proud of their achievements. They all have
  what it takes to build a successful career in motorsport. I am very
  excited to work with Josh, Ryder, and Thomas in 2026. As the name
  'Academy' suggests, we will coach the three in many areas – driving,
  mental and physical training, writing reports, media work – in all
  aspects that will help them progress as racing drivers. We mentors are
  there for them, always accessible and ready to share our knowledge and
  experience. Our goal is to improve their foundation, enabling them to
  take the next steps in their careers."

"The
  selection days were very exciting. We had twelve very strong
  candidates in Munich, which says a lot about the high level of our GT4
  programme. As a member of the BMW Junior Team, I can relate very well
  to the 'Class of 2026' and am closest to them in age. Alongside Jens,
  with his vast experience not only as a driver but also as a developer
  of racing cars, and Robby, with his customer racing and Esports
  background – I think we mentors complement each other perfectly."

"We
  presented our candidates with many different challenges during the
  selection process. All twelve were very mature for their age and
  impressed us. Even though only three made it into the 'Class of 2026,'
  I believe all of them have the potential for a great career in
  motorsport. I saw parts of myself in them. I also come from customer
  racing, so it is an honour for me to support them as a mentor with my experiences."

"Being part of the BMW M Racing
  Academy is a big step in the right direction for my career as a racing
  driver. Everyone entering sports car racing dreams of being associated
  with a manufacturer – and especially one with as much tradition and
  history as BMW M Motorsport. From the 'Class of 2026,' I hope to
  improve in terms of car dynamics and development, areas that interest
  me greatly. Additionally, I hope to make and deepen many connections."

"It was very special to experience
  during the selection days what a major manufacturer like BMW M
  Motorsport has to offer. Now being part of the 'Class of 2026' is a
  great honour. I always wanted to represent a manufacturer, and in a
  way, I am now doing that for customer racing in Australia. I am very
  excited to absorb as much as possible from what BMW M Motorsport
  offers me. Above all, the close contact with the mentors will be very
  valuable for me. This opportunity is fantastic."

"Just being one of the selected
  candidates for the assessment centre was already a great honour for
  me. Now being one of only three participants worldwide in the 'Class
  of 2026' is absolutely amazing. Our mentors are great guys, not just
  in terms of their sporting achievements but also as people. I expect a
  lot from working with them. I am sure I can learn an incredible amount
  from them and am really looking forward to it."
