The annual conclusion of the BMW M Sports Trophy has a long
  tradition. It is the evening when private teams and drivers take
  centre stage for BMW M Motorsport, acting as ambassadors for the BMW M
  brand with their racing efforts around the world. The importance of
  these customers was underscored by the presence of Sylvia Neubauer,
  Vice President Customer, Brand, Sales at BMW M GmbH, who is now a
  regular guest at the BMW M Night of Trophies, and Head of BMW M
  Motorsport Andreas Roos.

As part of the BMW M Sports Trophy, private teams and drivers collect
  points for the final standings based on their results in their
  respective racing series. In the drivers' standings, Justin Rothberg
  once again claimed first place, scoring 930 points to edge out the duo
  of Berkay Besler (TUR) and Gabriele Piana (ITA), who tied with 858
  points. Driving the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for Turner Motorsport, Rothberg won
  two titles. He triumphed in GT America and, alongside BMW M works
  driver Robby Foley (USA), claimed victory in the Pro-Am category of
  the GT World Challenge America.

In the team standings, there was a close duel between two German
  teams for the win. FK Performance Motorsport ultimately prevailed with
  1,676 points, narrowly beating Schubert Motorsport (1,620 points).
  Third place went to last year's winners, Turner Motorsport (1,576
  points). FK Performance Motorsport achieved a milestone in 2025 by
  becoming the first team to win the overall standings of the
  Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) with the BMW M4 GT4. At the 24-hour
  race on the Nordschleife, the team reached the podium in its class.
  With the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, FK Performance Motorsport played a leading
  role in the ADAC GT Masters, finishing second in the team standings.

During the BMW M Night of Trophies, the new members of the BMW M
  Racing Academy, BMW M Motorsport's support programme for customer
  racing, were officially introduced. The "Class of 2026"
  consists of German Thomas Rackl, American Josh Green, and Australian
  Ryder Quinn. The trio shared the stage with BMW M Racing Academy
  mentors Jens Klingmann, Max Hesse (both GER), and Robby Foley.

"It is
  truly special to welcome our most successful customer racers to
  Garching, where the heart of BMW M beats. They perfectly embody the
  DNA of our brand and, with their performances on racetracks around the
  world, serve as ideal ambassadors. While we celebrate the victories
  and titles of our works drivers and teams, our emotional connection to
  customer racing is equally profound. Without it, BMW M Motorsport
  would not be the same. It is a central pillar of our racing programme
  and will remain so in the future. I congratulate this year's winners,
  Justin Rothberg and FK Performance Motorsport, as well as all other
  award recipients tonight, on their fantastic achievements during the
  past season."

"An evening like this fills me with pride.
  Pride in the successes of our teams and drivers, but also pride in the
  incredible group of personalities we have once again brought together
  under the umbrella of the BMW M Sports Trophy this year. I am also
  proud of the achievements of our engineers, who have hit the mark with
  the EVO versions of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4. The successes of
  both cars in their debut seasons are impressive. Thank you to everyone
  who contributed to this. And congratulations to tonight's winners,
  Justin Rothberg and FK Performance Motorsport!"

"We look back with pride on an impressive customer
  racing season. In 2025, we had 56 GT3 and 88 GT4 cars in action
  worldwide, collectively covering over 700,000 racing kilometres and
  achieving around 180 victories and 250 additional podium finishes
  across various classes. Our customer racing drivers and teams
  celebrated victories and titles in Europe, North America, Asia, and
  Australia. This underlines how globally successful our BMW M Sports
  Trophy family is. The best driver, as in 2024, was Justin Rothberg.
  His performances in the cockpit of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO have been
  outstanding. For the second consecutive year, he dominated the U.S.
  SRO racing series in his class. Personally, I am also very pleased
  with the second-place finish of our BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay
  Besler. FK Performance Motorsport rewarded themselves with the triumph
  in the team standings for their fantastic commitment to the BMW M
  brand, with numerous cars in both the GT3 and GT4 segments.
  Congratulations to all the winners!"

"Super thrilled to be winning
  the Sports Trophy again this year. The BMWs are great race cars and
  there’s so many talented drivers so it’s an accomplishment I’m proud
  of. It’s a testament to the great work from all the guys at Turner
  Motorsport: Will Turner for running such a well oiled machine, Robby
  Foley for always putting in great drives and giving me the help and
  advice I need – and my parents for supporting me and putting me in a
  position to succeed."

"It is a great challenge every year to compete against
  so many great teams within the Sports Trophy. We can only do our best
  again and again, and this year we were lucky enough to come first. We
  are very proud of that. Overall, we had a great season with a great
  team performance. In the end, we lacked a bit of luck here and there
  and didn't quite achieve our championship goals. But we'll be going
  for it again next season."
