For the seventh consecutive year,
  Frieze and BMW continue their long-term partnership with the art
  initiative

French artist

worked closely with BMW to present “LA POTION (EH)” - a
  video and gaming experience, using BMW’s My Modes and the new
  AirConsole technology of the BMW i5 as a playing device. Both works
  will premiere at KOKO inside the BMW Open Work Lounge during Frieze
  London, which runs October 11-15, 2023. In celebration of their
  collaboration, Frieze and BMW proudly announce London-based musician

as this year's

performer.

is a joint initiative between Frieze
  and BMW, bringing together art, innovation, technology and design in a
  pioneering multi-platform format. Curated by

, BMW Open Work invites an artist to develop an
  ambitious project utilising BMW technology and design to pursue their
  practice in new directions. This year, the invited artist is
  Marseille-based Sara Sadik, whose practice lies halfway between
  fiction and documentary. Her work, be it video or performance, is
  inspired by video games, anime, science-fiction as well as French rap,
  and puts forward characters facing challenges and striving to achieve
  moral and physical transformation through initiatory stories.

, says: “For my BMW Open Work 2023
  commission I was interested in creating a work that could have
  transformational qualities for its viewers. I chose the title ‘LA
  POTION (EH)’ to hint at a tangible emotional metamorphosis. Inspired
  by a close dialogue with the BMW gaming (Air Console) and My Modes
  teams, I decided to see the BMW i5 as a character, the Avatar Neregy
  exploring different imaginary worlds both in the video game and in the
  video. It is also extremely exciting for me to build for the first
  time a work that can be seen by the general public during Frieze Week
  on the outside of KOKO as well as played exclusively in the car.”

Conceived as part of BMW Open Work 2023,

continues the artist’s interest in the possibilities of
  computer-generated scenarios and her investigation into the changing
  emotional states of young male characters. The project unfolds as an
  interactive video game, devised to be played exclusively in the new,
  fully electric BMW i5 as well as a video installation presented both
  on the public-facing terrace of KOKO and inside the BMW Lounge. Guided
  by the Avatar Neregy, a virtually alienated character who struggles to
  connect with people, the viewer follows him across different worlds,
  tasks, and challenges to complete his quest for psychological healing
  and transformation.

“I am delighted that our successful partnership with Frieze
  continues. BMW’s commitment to contemporary art is an integral part of
  our worldwide cultural engagement which has been ongoing for over 50
  years. I am pleased that so many will get to experience Sara Sadik’s
  ‘BMW Open Work’, which has been specially conceived for the fully
  electric BMW i5”, says

Inspired by dialogues with the

(AirConsole) as well as the

– which allows
  the driver to set the car to their mood – Sadik has imagined the new
  BMW i5 as a character, a unique device that invites the public to
  delve into their emotions. Turning the car, for the first time in BMW
  Open Work history, into a special experiential device through the
  immersive activation of light and sound features and embracing the
  topics of human centricity and digitalization, the BMW i5 becomes a
  sentient being, a journey companion.

“Working with an exciting and visionary artist such as Sara Sadik on
  this project has brought BMW Open Work to a new frontier.  Her new
  video and playable game LA POTION (EH) was spurred from an intense
  collaboration with BMW experts and imagines, for the first time, the
  BMW i5 as a guiding character, a device and an exhibition venue. I
  can’t wait to let the work guide us through imaginary worlds and
  challenges to explore the changing emotional states of users/players
  and drivers alike”, explains

In celebration of their long-term
  collaboration, BMW partners with Frieze to present Frieze Music in
  London again. On

, Mercury Music
  Prize-nominated artist

will perform at
  the legendary KOKO Theatre. Loyle Carner is an English Hip-Hop
  musician celebrated for his sophisticated style. He has received three
  Brit Award nominations for British Breakthrough Act (2018), British
  Male Solo Artist (2018) and British Urban Act (2023). In addition,

will start with a DJ set for an evening
  celebrating 20 years of Frieze London.

Exploring the intersection of music and the arts to spark inspiring
  dialogues, Frieze Music provides artists the opportunity to create a
  unique performance, highlighting their craft through song, inspiration
  and conversations with fellow artists. Launched during the inaugural
  Frieze Los Angeles in 2019, the joint initiative between BMW and
  Frieze has brought together a wide range of musicians.

says:“We are delighted to continue our partnership with BMW,
  highlighting Frieze's commitment to exploring the possibilities of
  art, design, and technology. Since 2017, BMW has consistently
  amplified the voices of leading and emerging international artists and
  musicians through our joint initiatives, both at the fair and across
  the city. We eagerly anticipate this year's collaborations for Frieze
  London and Frieze Masters, with Sara Sadik leading BMW Open Work and
  Loyle Carner taking centre stage with Frieze Music, as we celebrate
  Frieze London's 20th Anniversary and the thriving creative spirit of
  the capital.”
