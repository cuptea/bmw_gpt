BMW M’s high-performance vehicles will soon
  deliver the ‘Ultimate Driving Machine’ experience in electric form.
  From 2027, BMW M will usher in a new era in the high-performance
  vehicle segment and, for the first time, bring BMW M’s motto, “Born on
  the racetrack. Made for the streets. Core of a passionate community”,
  to life with a fully electric drivetrain. “The next generation of
  models are set to establish a new benchmark in the high-performance
  vehicle segment,” says Franciscus van Meel, Managing Director of BMW M
  GmbH. “With the latest generation of Neue Klasse technology, we are
  taking the BMW M driving experience to a new level and will inspire
  our customers with outstanding, racetrack-ready driving dynamics for
  everyday use.”

The future model generation embodies the DNA of the high-performance
  brand with authenticity and advances the distinct BMW M driving
  experience. The fully electric drivetrain redefines the brand’s
  dynamics, combining driving pleasure with racetrack capability in an
  unprecedented way. Long range, high charging performance thanks to
  800-volt technology, and highly efficient energy recuperation make the
  fully electric BMW M models a versatile everyday companion. The newly
  developed architecture with centrally controlled individual wheel
  drive opens up a new dimension of driving dynamics and further
  increases the driving safety of all BMW M next-generation vehicles.

The significant gains in driving dynamics are also the result of the
  forward-looking central control and electronics architecture of the
  Neue Klasse. Four high-performance computers, known as “Superbrains,”
  unite computing power for driving dynamics (“Heart of Joy”), automated
  driving, infotainment, as well as basic and comfort functions. In
  addition to enhanced overall performance through accelerated data
  exchange, the next-generation BMW M models also benefit from faster
  updates and upgrades.

The BMW M models has been developed from the ground up. At the
  core of the new architecture is BMW M eDrive, which is based on the
  BMW Gen6 technology of the Neue Klasse. Each wheel is driven by an
  electric motor. In combination with the M-specific control software of
  the ‘Heart of Joy’, the ‘BMW M Dynamic Performance Control’ unlocks
  completely new potentials in driving dynamics and safety for
  high-performance vehicles. Additionally, the system enables maximum
  recuperation and optimum traction right up to the limit, as well as a
  more direct response.

In all electric models of BMW M, two electric drive units on the
  front and rear axles, each with one electric motor per wheel, ensure
  driving performance expected from BMW M. Each of the four electric
  motors drives one wheel. This concept combines all the advantages of
  rear-wheel and all-wheel drive while enhancing driving dynamics on the
  road and racetrack. Additionally, the front axle can be completely
  decoupled. The result is BMW M’s renowned rear-wheel drive with its
  dynamic driving characteristics, enhanced efficiency, and increased
  range, for example, on longer motorway journeys. For the unmistakable
  BMW M driving experience and enhanced drivability, various predefined
  driving modes, simulated gear shifts, and a newly developed soundscape
  come into play. These are just a few examples of how BMW M channels
  pure emotion into the fully electric BMW M models, making it felt in
  every single drive.

The electric drive units of BMW M eDrive are characterised by high
  power density and are the most powerful drives BMW M has ever used. In
  both drive units, the electric motors are arranged in parallel, each
  delivering power to one gearbox per wheel. The drive units also
  integrate the inverter for controlling the electric motors and the oil
  supply. The system enables precise control of torque and power at each
  individual wheel, allowing for optimal traction, continuous torque
  distribution between the braking system and electric motors, as well
  as brake energy recuperation right up to the limit. The result is a
  driving experience in BMW M production vehicles that has never been
  achieved before.

The high-voltage battery, boasting over 100 kWh of usable energy
  as the powerhouse for the BMW M eDrive system, has also been
  specifically adapted to meet the demands of high-performance vehicles.
  The focus remains on compatibility with both road and racetrack use.
  This is achieved through a "Design to Power" approach,
  featuring a performance-optimized variant of the Gen6 cylindrical
  cell. Supporting this, the cooling system and the Energy Master — the
  highly intelligent control center of the battery located outside the
  battery pack — have been optimized for higher power outputs. With BMW
  M specific solutions, the Gen6 high-voltage battery in the fully
  electric high-performance models delivers even greater peak and
  charging performance. Additionally, the BMW M models with Gen6
  technology offer the highest recuperation values. The high-voltage
  battery housing also serves as a structural component of the vehicle
  and is connected to the front and rear axles. The higher resulting
  stiffness in the overall vehicle also leads to improved driving dynamics.

Apart from innovations related to driving performance, high-tech
  will be also reflected by new and innovative materials. Lightweight
  construction has always played an important role in high-performance
  models. Therefore, BMW M will introduce for the very first-time
  natural fibre elements within the fully electric BMW M
  high-performance model line-up.

The brand gained significant experience in durability, production,
  and integration using natural fibre in motorsport since 2019. This
  material offers similar properties to carbon fibre but can be produced
  with around 40 per cent less CO
