BMW Motorrad Motorsport has used the break in action to make more
  progress with the new BMW M 1000 RR. At the end of March, both teams
  attended tests at Barcelona, where they were able to evaluate various
  components and set-up solutions. The riders in action were van der
  Mark and Scott Redding (GBR) for the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team,
  and Garrett Gerloff (USA) for the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team.

Loris Baz (FRA) was unable to take part in the test, due to the
  injuries he sustained to his right leg at the second round of the
  season at Mandalika (IDN) at the start of March. However, he plans to
  return to the Assen grid, if the race doctors give him the green light
  to do so.

Gerloff travels straight to Assen from his native USA. Last weekend,
  he visited the MotoGP Grand Prix of the Americas in Austin (USA),
  where he performed a demonstration run on the new BMW M 1000 RR MotoGP
  Safety Bike.

“The
  break after the double-header in Australia and Indonesia was a long
  one, and you get the feeling that the season is now really getting
  underway. We saw a significant upward trend at Mandalika, but for
  various reasons were not always able to convert it into corresponding
  results. We have upped our game again during the break and evaluated
  various updates for the BMW M 1000 RR. Our goal is to cut the gap to
  the front-runners again at Assen, and thus to lay the foundation for a
  strong European season. Assen is something very special – the history,
  the atmosphere, the passionate fans. There is still some doubt about
  what weather we can expect, but we have to be prepared for everything.
  It is great that Loris feels ready for action again after his
  injuries, and that he will start if the doctors allow it. He will
  definitely still be impaired, but it is important for us all to also
  have his feedback for the set-up of the bikes.”

“I’m really excited to head to Assen this weekend
  straight from MotoGP at Austin. I had a great weekend at the Grand
  Prix with BMW, doing some PR stuff, but I’m obviously looking forward
  to getting back to racing myself. We had a test with the Bonovo action
  BMW Racing Team at Assen not so long ago and it was really good and
  productive. I had the feeling we figured out a bunch of stuff that we
  can use for the race weekend. So, I’m looking forward to it and will
  just try to go fast.”

“Assen is a circuit that has been good for us in the
  past. I did not too bad there last year and hopefully we can improve a
  little bit. We have had a bit of time off which has been nice to
  regroup a little bit. Now let’s see what we can do. You never know
  what the weather will do at Assen, that is always a tricky one, but we
  will be there to do our best anyway.”

“I am obviously happy to be racing again. It
  has been a long break since Indonesia but for me it was good to cure
  my injured fingers. It takes some time and is still not perfect but it
  will be no problem when riding. So it’s great to race again,
  especially at Assen in front of the Dutch fans. This year I am much
  fitter than last year so I am looking forward to it. The weather seems
  to be perfect so I can’t wait to go fast in front of my home fans.”

“I was trying everything to be in Assen. I got the final
  approval from the surgeon on Friday morning, so all is good on this
  side. Now it’s all about how I’ll feel on the bike and we will see how
  it’s going to be. For sure, I have a lack of movement on the ankle and
  the knee, so especially in the right corners, I have to see how it’s
  going to be. It’s definitely not dangerous at all, there is no risk,
  at least no more risk than normal. I am training and working as hard
  as I can with the physio and all the people around me. I’m really
  looking forward to being in Assen. I really love that track! It would
  have been a heartbreak for me not to be at Assen. I’ll just do the
  best I can. If I feel good, I’ll push as hard as I can to go and
  improve the bike. If the ankle is a bit of a problem on Friday, then
  we’ll maybe decide to just take it more easy. At the moment it’s very
  hard to understand what to expect, but I’m just really happy to be
  back on the bike. It’s been tough six weeks, but we were lucky with
  the calendar.”
