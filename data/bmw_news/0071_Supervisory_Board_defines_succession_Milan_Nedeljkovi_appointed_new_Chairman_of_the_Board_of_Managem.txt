. Dr.-Ing. Milan Nedeljković will assume the
  role of Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG effective on 14
  May 2026. The company’s Supervisory Board took this decision today.
  Following the successful launch of the Neue Klasse, Nedeljković will
  succeed Oliver Zipse, who has been a member of the Board of Management
  of BMW AG for more than ten years and has served as its Chairman since
  August 2019. The Supervisory Board extends its sincere thanks to
  Oliver Zipse for his outstanding achievements for the BMW Group.

"Milan Nedeljković convinces with his strategic foresight,
  strong implementation skills, and entrepreneurial thinking. He stands
  for very focused management of resources—whether financial or
  ecological," said Dr. Nicolas Peter, Chairman of the Supervisory
  Board of BMW AG. " Milan Nedeljković inspires people with ideas,
  unites them behind shared values, and thereby motivates them to
  realize peak performance. This is a crucial leadership quality to
  maintain the BMW Group’s successful course in this time of transformation."

In 2023, Oliver Zipse’s contract as Chairman of the Board of
  Management of BMW AG was extended beyond the usual retirement age
  until 2026. Subsequently, he will leave the Board of Management as
  planned after the Annual General Meeting on 13 May 2026, concluding a
  total of 35 years with the BMW Group.

"Oliver Zipse has made a significant contribution to the BMW
  Group and deserves our sincere gratitude. He has led BMW through
  global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and represents the Neue
  Klasse as the largest strategic project in the company’s
  history," said Peter. "Oliver Zipse has always prioritized
  BMW’s success. He consistently took a clear stance—even in the face of
  great external headwinds—and thus kept the company on track during
  turbulent times."

Milan Nedeljković, the designated Chairman of the Board of
  Management, has been a member of the Board of Management of BMW AG
  since 2019 and is currently responsible for the Production division.
  The 56-year-old began his professional career at BMW as a Trainee in
  1993 and has accumulated extensive international experience. He has
  held senior leadership positions at Plant Oxford, as Managing Director
  Plant Leipzig and Munich and as Senior Vice President Corporate
  Quality. His contract as Chairman of the Board of Management will
  extend into 2031.

Dr. Martin Kimmich, Chairman of the Global Works Council and deputy
  Chairman of the Supervisory Board, said: "Milan Nedeljković is
  held in high regard by and enjoys the trust of BMW’s workforce.
  Together with him, we look forward to continuing the long tradition of
  cooperative collaboration between the Works Council and corporate
  management as a foundation for our BMW success story."
