“In recent weeks, GT racing series around the world have been
  deciding their titles. Now it’s time to reap the rewards for the hard
  work put in throughout the season. Our BMW M Motorsport teams and
  drivers in North America have done this in an incredibly impressive
  fashion. A huge congratulations and sincere compliments to Random
  Vandals Racing, Turner Motorsport, and BimmerWorld Racing, who
  achieved a clean sweep in the SRO series with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and
  BMW M4 GT4 EVO, winning all available titles. The record in the GT
  World Challenge America, GT America, and GT4 America is truly out of
  this world! I’m very sorry for BMW Italia Ceccato Racing that, despite
  an outstanding season, they just missed out on further titles. The
  final race was a bitter one. Nevertheless, the team and drivers once
  again proved what fantastic ambassadors they are for our brand in Italy.”

BMW Italia Ceccato Racing and BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER)
  narrowly missed out on their third consecutive title in the Italian GT
  Championship Sprint. Despite a victory and a third-place finish at the
  season finale at Monza (ITA), Klingmann and his works driver teammate
  Jesse Krohn (FIN) had to settle for second place overall. Driving the
  #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, the duo claimed three wins and three additional
  podiums in eight races. After a dramatic finale, they fell just three
  points short of the championship lead. Klingmann and the team had won
  the Sprint title in the previous two seasons.

“You can’t win the title every year, but I’m very proud of what we
  achieved as a team because we truly made the most of our
  opportunities,” said Klingmann. “With our victory in Saturday’s race,
  we were back in the title fight, but unfortunately, third place on
  Sunday wasn’t quite enough. I think we deserved it too, but this time
  Lamborghini had the upper hand. Congratulations to the crew of car
  #63. We’ll be back to fight again next year.” Krohn added: “Even
  though the end of the season feels bittersweet, I really enjoyed
  racing in Italy again. I think we gave everything we could in the
  title fight. Unfortunately, it just wasn’t enough. My overall season
  has been extremely positive – I’ve taken wins and podiums everywhere I
  raced, and above all, I won the 24h Nürburgring. I’m very happy with
  this year.”

The title race in the Pro-Am category also remained thrilling until
  the final event. William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA)
  entered the last race as championship leaders but were forced to
  retire after an unavoidable collision with their #2 BMW M4 GT3 EVO,
  dropping to third in the final standings.

The Indianapolis 8 Hour just over a week ago was not only the season
  finale of the Intercontinental GT Challenge – where Team WRT triumphed
  and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) secured the drivers’ title – it also
  marked the conclusion of the GT World Challenge America powered by
  AWS. BMW M Motorsport teams continued their incredible run of success
  there with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The title in the Pro category went to
  BMW M works driver Connor De Phillippi and his Random Vandals Racing
  teammate Kenton Koch (both USA). “I’m really proud to be part of this
  team,” said Koch. “Working with Connor all season has been amazing. We
  came in with things to learn, but we’ve shown incredible performances
  throughout the year. I’m proud of everyone and excited for what’s to
  come.” De Phillippi added: “It’s been an amazing effort from the
  entire team. I’m so proud of this group. This championship is my first
  with BMW, and that makes it even more meaningful. Hopefully it’s just
  the start of many more together.”

In the Pro-Am category, BMW M works driver Robby Foley and his young
  Turner Motorsport teammate Justin Rothberg (both USA) celebrated
  another title win, just like last year. “Justin has made incredible
  progress this season, he’s on a great trajectory,” said Foley. “Our
  second year working together has been awesome; we were faster, more
  consistent, and racked up more wins. Huge thanks to Turner Motorsport,
  Laticrete, all our partners, and every member of this incredible
  team.” Rothberg added: “The stars really aligned for us. Indy came
  through again. Robby and I are champions once more, and it feels fantastic.”

The celebrations among the BMW M Motorsport teams knew no bounds in
  both GT4 America and GT America. At the GT4 America Indianapolis (USA)
  season finale, all three class titles went to crews running the BMW M4
  GT4 EVO. In the Silver class, Kenton Koch and Kevin Boehm (both USA)
  from Random Vandals Racing took the championship crown. Hats off to
  the whole Random Vandals Racing team this year. They've given us a
  rocketship every single race, I think we’ve consistently been one of
  the fastest BMWs this whole season,” said Boehm. “I think it just goes
  into the preparation that they do behind the scenes. What a day!” Koch
  pulled off the remarkable feat of winning championships with both BMW
  M Motorsport GT cars. Random Vandals Racing also dominated thePro-Am
  category, where Josh Green and Sam Craven (both USA) secured the title
  in the #94 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. “It’s been an amazing season for Josh and
  me,” said Craven. “It was our first time in SRO, and Random Vandals
  Racing did an incredible job. The whole team was just awesome,
  awesome, awesome!”

In the Am class, there was also no getting past the BMW M4 GT4 EVO.
  James Clay and Charlie Postins (both USA) from the BimmerWorld Racing
  team celebrated the championship victory. “I totally wanted it,” said
  Clay. “But I was reminded of patience that I rarely show, but I showed
  it today. That’s what you have to do to win the championship. It was a
  great battle. Thank you guys for all the memories made over the last
  four seasons.”

In GT America, Justin Rothberg completed his double title success
  with Turner Motorsport in the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, securing both
  championships for himself and the team. This brought team principal
  Will Turner’s squad their 11th and 12th titles in 28 years of racing –
  exclusively with BMW M Motorsport cars. “Coming into this race, I was
  hopeful that we’d win another championship, but walking away with two
  is surreal,” said Turner. “I knew the team could do it, and things
  just went our way. I’m super excited and ready to shoot for it again
  next year. Every championship that we’ve had over the years has been a
  little bit different, and they’re all special in different ways. Some
  are harder than others, and this one was certainly difficult, but the
  effort paid off.”
