A look at WorldSBK, the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC)
  and numerous other championships across Europe, North and South
  America, Asia and Australia shows that BMW racers were even more
  successful in 2025 than in the previous year. Overall, they stood on
  the podium 411 times, achieving 169 wins and 242 additional podium
  finishes. This means that the factory riders and BMW customer racers
  once again surpassed the already outstanding figures from the previous
  year (371 / 142 / 229).

“Behind us lies a season that surpassed our successes from 2024 once
  again – in factory racing as well as in customer racing,” says Sven
  Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport. “Toprak’s successful title
  defense in WorldSBK will remain unforgettable, with no fewer than 21
  wins in 36 races. In the FIM Endurance World Championship, we were
  also on course for the title in a dramatic finale until just minutes
  before the finish, before a technical issue prevented this potentially
  historic success for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. But next
  year we will have another chance to become world champions in
  endurance racing as well. In customer racing, private riders and teams
  in a wide range of series around the world consistently achieved top
  results and numerous titles. BMW riders also celebrated further
  sensational victories in road racing. All these successes fill us with
  great pride – they prove that the BMW M 1000 RR is a true winning
  motorcycle and that our global BMW Motorrad Motorsport family is
  stronger than ever.”

“The BMW M 1000 RR is one of the best bikes in international racing –
  and this season once again showed that our customers can rely on it in
  championships around the globe,” says Uwe Geyer, Head of BMW Motorrad
  Customer Racing. “We are proud to be able to provide private teams and
  riders with such a strong package. The race version of the BMW M 1000
  RR forms an excellent foundation, and with our global support network
  we help our customers convert this potential into titles and victories
  in their championships. Our racing components originate from our
  factory racing efforts, and all our customers worldwide benefit from
  the close cooperation between our factory teams, the BMW Motorrad
  WorldSBK Test Team and our development department.”

Once again in the 2025 season, there was no way past the BMW riders
  in international road racing. The action began with the North West
  200, where the BMW M 1000 RR claimed victories in all five races.
  Davey Todd (GBR) secured three wins, while Michael Dunlop (GBR) won
  the other two races. In addition, Todd, Peter Hickman and Ian
  Hutchinson (both GBR) collected further podium finishes. At the
  legendary Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, Todd and Dunlop achieved a
  one-two finish in the Superbike TT, and both riders also stepped onto
  the podium in the two Superstock races. The Senior TT, in which BMW
  racers were among the main favorites, was cancelled due to weather
  conditions. The motorsport world then turns its attention every
  November to the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix to close out the season.
  Here, the BMW road racers delivered an outstanding one-two-three
  result, with Todd taking victory ahead of Hickman and Erno Kostamo (FIN).
