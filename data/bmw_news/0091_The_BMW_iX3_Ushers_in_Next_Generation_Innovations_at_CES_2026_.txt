The new BMW iX3 is in the spotlight at CES
  2026. For the first time, the enhanced, AI-powered BMW Intelligent
  Personal Assistant with Alexa+ technology will be presented to the
  public. As the debut model for the Neue Klasse, the BMW iX3 showcases
  groundbreaking innovations that will shape the entire model range of
  the brand in the future. By 2027, the technologies of the Neue Klasse
  will be integrated into a total of 40 new models and model updates
  from BMW.

One year after the world premiere of the new BMW
  Panoramic iDrive with BMW Operating System X at CES 2025, visitors to
  this year’s CES can experience the revolutionary user-interaction
  concept firsthand in the BMW iX3. With a balanced combination of
  digital functions and physical elements, it elevates intuitive
  operation according to BMW’s guiding principle ‘Hands on the Wheel,
  Eyes on the Road’ to a new level of driver orientation. Built on the
  technological foundation of a software-defined vehicle, the customer
  experience in the BMW iX3 continues to evolve.

BMW is the first
  manufacturer to expand its voice assistant with the AI assistant
  Amazon Alexa+. This enables intuitive and intelligent interaction
  between passengers and the vehicle in a natural dialogue. The
  interaction includes the operation of vehicle functions as well as
  access to information and knowledge beyond the vehicle. For the first
  time, passengers can ask multiple questions in a single
  sentence—covering both your vehicle’s features and e.g. general
  knowledge topics.

The integration of Amazon Alexa+ into the BMW Intelligent Personal
  Assistant represents a technological leap forward that focuses on
  added value for the customer. The AI technology used in the BMW
  Intelligent Personal Assistant is a Large Language Model (LLM), a
  generative AI that understands language and is capable of formulating
  its own responses. Starting in the second half of 2026 at the latest,
  this further development will be gradually rolled out in Germany and
  the USA across all BMW models equipped with BMW Operating System 9 and X.

The BMW booth at CES also focuses on the wide range
  of entertainment options in BMW Operating System X. It offers an
  extensive selection of apps, videos, and games. In addition to the
  popular streaming service

, customers in the
  BMW iX3 have access to the

(powered by
  TiVo™). This app enables video streaming on the central display when
  the vehicle is stationary, with a continuously growing selection of
  content such as news, live, and on-demand streaming. The portfolio of
  the video streaming platform will continue to evolve.

will also soon include
  the

app for the first time, joining the

. YouTube Music gives customers access to an extensive
  catalog with over 300 million tracks, including the official studio
  recordings, remixes, live performances, and hard-to-find covers.

now allows video calls on the iX3’s central
  display for the first time when the vehicle is stationary. As soon as
  the vehicle starts moving, the video transmission stops, and the
  conversation seamlessly continues via audio.

In-car gaming via AirConsole, as introduced for the first time with
  the BMW Operating System 8.5, is also available in the new BMW iX3,
  featuring world-renowned titles like UNO

Car Party!

A new highlight in AirConsole’s extensive game library is

from Mattel,
  available exclusively to BMW customers. AirConsole allows users to use
  their own smartphones as controllers, so all passengers can play
  together or compete against each other. Additional games and apps for
  in-car entertainment can be accessed through the BMW ConnectedDrive
  Store. Selected games in the BMW iX3 can also be controlled using
  Bluetooth controllers from conventional gaming consoles.

The sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology developed for the
  Neue Klasse comprises highly efficient electric motors, fundamentally
  new high-voltage batteries with cylindrical cells, and 800V
  technology. The BMW iX3 50 xDrive is powered by two electric motors,
  which together generate output of 345 kW/469 hp and 645 Nm (475 lb-ft)
  of torque. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.9 seconds
  and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (130 mph). Its electric
  all-wheel-drive configuration consists of an extensively upgraded
  electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) with particularly high
  levels of efficiency at the rear axle and, at the front axle, a new
  asynchronous motor (ASM) distinguished by its compact design and high
  cost efficiency. The combination of EESM and ASM is evidence of the
  BMW Group’s commitment to technological neutrality within electric
  mobility as well. The drive technology developed for the Neue Klasse
  reduces energy losses by 40 per cent compared to fifth-generation BMW
  eDrive technology, weight by 10 per cent and manufacturing costs by 20
  per cent.

The new high-voltage battery concept with cylindrical cells for the
  Neue Klasse also achieves significant advances. The energy density on
  a cell level is 20 per cent higher than with fifth-generation BMW
  eDrive technology, and the new concept also paves the way for a 30 per
  cent increase in charging speed. The cylindrical cells are integrated
  directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell to pack”), which
  benefits energy density and cost efficiency. Added to which, the
  high-voltage battery is integrated into the vehicle architecture as a
  structural component to minimise weight (“pack to open body”). The
  high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has a usable energy
  content of 108.7 kWh, enabling a range of up to 805 kilometres (500
  miles) in the WLTP cycle.

The advances brought by sixth-generation BMW
  eDrive technology have a significant influence on the charging
  experience, too. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables users to
  fill their new BMW iX3 with enough energy at an 800V direct current
  (DC) rapid charging station to add up to 372 kilometres (231 miles)

of range in just ten minutes. The high-voltage battery
  can charge from 10 to 80 per cent capacity in 21 minutes. Thanks to
  the battery management tech with integrated switching matrix developed
  completely in-house by the BMW Group, the new BMW iX3 can also be
  charged from 400V DC stations. Upgrades to the battery preparation
  also help to shorten charging times. The new BMW iX3 50 xDrive can top
  up on alternating current (AC) at 11 kW as standard or 22 kW

as an option.

Extensive bidirectional charging functions

are also
  available for the new BMW iX3, meaning that it can be used as an
  energy supply source for a variety of applications. The
  Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function turns the new BMW iX3 into a mobile
  powerbank, which can supply electric devices with power while on the
  move. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) hands it the role of storage unit for
  solar energy generated by home-fitted photovoltaic systems. And
  customers can also hook their car up to the energy market via the
  Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) application and earn some money in the process.

The selection of standard-fitted and optional charging accessories
  has been significantly expanded. For flexible charging during a
  journey, customers can make use of the new Multifunction Charger,
  which comes with several adapters for charging and discharging the
  high-voltage battery. The new BMW Wallbox Professional (DC) enables
  bidirectional charging at home or work. And BMW Charging offers the
  option of cost-optimised /solar-power-optimised home charging.

In order to give owners the best possible charging experience, the
  new BMW iX3 will be fitted as standard with an NACS (North American
  Charging Standard) compatible charging port. This will provide iX3
  owners access to the vast Supercharger network, while a standard CCS
  (Combined Charging System) adapter will preserve access to other
  providers from coast to coast, thus ensuring that iX3 owners are never
  far from a provider no matter where the journey is taking them.

One of four superbrains in the electronics architecture of the
  Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy looks after drivetrain and driving
  dynamics management. This high-performance control unit is responsible
  for the drivetrain, brakes, energy recuperation, and steering
  functions, and processes information up to ten times faster than
  conventional control units. In this way, the potential of electric
  mobility in terms of instantaneous power delivery, smooth power
  transfer, agility, stability, and efficiency is fully realized.

Together with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack
  developed fully in-house, the Heart of Joy calculates all the driving
  dynamics parameters with a new level of speed and precision. The
  driver and passengers in the new BMW iX3 experience a uniquely
  harmonious and BMW-typical driving sensation whatever the situation.
  Every movement of the accelerator, brake pedal, and steering is
  executed directly and with assurance and precision. Supreme traction
  and – thanks to the unique Soft Stop function – the smoothest stopping
  process ever achieved by a BMW are among its other attributes. In
  addition, the efficiency of the new BMW iX3 is optimized by the
  integrated management of drivetrain, braking system, and energy
  recuperation. In everyday driving, 98% of braking maneuvers are
  carried out using recuperation only, without application of the
  friction brakes. The only occasions these are called upon are under
  emergency braking and during extremely sporty driving.

Another high-performance computer brings
  together all the automated driving and parking functions in the BMW
  iX3. With 20 times greater processing power than in the previous
  vehicle generation, the watercooled “superbrain of automated driving”
  enables a significant technological advance with the Neue Klasse in
  this area as well.

The BMW iX3 uses its Symbiotic Drive capability
  combined with driver assistance to create a completely new driving
  experience. Whenever the driver wants to accelerate, brake or steer,
  their inputs merge seamlessly and intuitively with AI-enabled
  software.The result is a whole new form of Sheer Driving Pleasure. For
  example, the automatic cruise control system is not deactivated with
  only a light press of the brake pedal; instead, it is only switched
  off when the driver brakes harder. In the same way, the lane control
  assistance remains active even after light steering inputs by the driver.

With the optional BMW Highway / Motorway Assistant

,
  drivers can take their hands off the steering wheel permanently at
  speeds of up to 85 mph / 130 km/h, while remaining attentive and ready
  to intervene. The system assists with vehicle guidance within the lane
  and can also perform automated lane changes when needed – a simple
  glance confirmation by the driver is sufficient. With active BMW Maps
  route guidance, the system proactively suggests lane changes at
  highway interchanges and exits, which can be confirmed with a quick
  glance in the wing mirror. The Highway Assistant remains active while
  passing through interchanges and until the end of highway exits. This
  allows BMW iX3 drivers to enjoy Level 2 driver assistance without
  touching the steering wheel in even more situations.

The new Highway and City Assistant

also offers
  innovative functions for urban environments, such as stopping and
  automatically restarting at traffic lights. Additional driver
  assistance features for complex urban driving situations will be
  rolled out later via over-the-air software updates.
