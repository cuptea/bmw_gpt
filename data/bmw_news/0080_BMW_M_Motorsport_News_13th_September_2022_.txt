A first for the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) was, as part of
  the NLS, a 12-hour race, held at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER)
  for the first time at the weekend. The race was split into two parts,
  with six hours on Saturday and six hours on Sunday. The BMW M
  Motorsport teams picked up seven class wins at the event.

Victory in the SP9 AM class went to Walkenhorst Motorsport with the
  #36 BMW M4 GT3. Henry Walkenhorst, Friedrich von Bohlen, Jörn
  Schmidt-Staade (all GER) and Anders Buchardt (NOR) took turns at the

  Martino (both GER) in the #883 BMW M2 CS Racing. Second place went to

BMW M works driver Alexander Sims (GBR) enjoyed a successful return
  to the British GT Championship. The Brit is contesting the final two
  race events of the season for Century Motorsport in the #91 BMW M4
  GT3. He shares the cockpit with Henry Dawes (GBR), who is racing in a
  GT3 car for the first time. The penultimate race of the season was
  held at Brands Hatch (GBR) at the weekend – and Sims and Dawes secured
  Century Motorsport’s first ever spot on the overall podium in the
  British GT Championship. The duo crossed the finish line in third
  place after a turbulent race. Sims also recorded the fastest lap of
  the race. In the GT4 class, Will Burns and Jack Brown (both GBR)
  finished ninth in the #90 BMW M4 GT4.

  Poulsen, Kristian Poulsen, Christoffer Nygaard (all DEN) and Alfred
  Nilsson (SWE) finished second in their class with the #14 car – and
  ended the 24-hour race in a superb fourth place overall.

ST Racing’s strong performance went unrewarded, however. The team
  consisting of Samantha Tan, Nick Wittmer (both CAN), Bryson Morris and
  Steven Aghakhani (both USA) led the field in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 for
  much of the race, before a mechanical failure forced them to retire.

  race two, Moritz Löhner (GER / #11) of FK Performance Motorsport also
  finished on the podium, in third place.

The first round of the BMW M2 Cup at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium
  offered plenty of thrilling racing action in changeable conditions and
  featured Maxime Oosten (NED / #54) and Fabian Kreim (GER / #43), who
  are embroiled in an exciting battle for the top spot in the table and
  the title.

In the first race on Saturday, Oosten claimed his fourth win of the
  season in difficult conditions with rain setting in. That saw him
  reclaim P1 in the table. Second place went to rookie Lorenz Stegmann
  (GER / #99). Kreim rounded off the podium in third place.

In race two on Sunday, it was all change again at the top of the
  championship. This race was characterised by close duels, collisions
  and spectacular overtaking manoeuvres. Kreim managed to avoid all the
  drama to clinch his third win of the season. Oosten had to make do
  with eighth place after being involved in a collision – and was forced
  to surrender the top spot in the table to Kreim once again. Second
  place in Sunday’s race went to Robert Hefler (GER / #53), with Michal
  Makeš (CZE / #47) finishing third. The penultimate race weekend of the
  season will be held at the Red Bull Ring (AUT), from 23rd to 25th September.

The L’Espace Bienvenue team secured another spot on the podium with
  the #17 BMW M4 GT4 at the penultimate race weekend of GT4 France 2022
  at Lédenon (FRA). Ricardo van der Ende (NED) and Benjamin Lessennes

  (both FRA) finished right behind him in third, in the #41 car.

The 2022 season of the ESET Cup Series ended with a title win for
  Trevor Racing. The final was held at Brno, Czechia last weekend, where
  Gregor Zsigo (SVK) and Dennis Waszek (CZE) were crowned champions of
  the GT3 Endurance classification. The duo finished second in the #16
  BMW M4 GT3 in the final endurance race of the season, which saw them
  clinch the title. Zsigo contested the same race in a BMW M6 GT3 as
  well, which he shared with Štefan Rosina (SVK). That saw Zsigo bag two
  spots on the podium, as he finished in third place alongside Rosina.
