For the third time in a row, BMW M GmbH ended
  the financial year as the global market leader in the performance and
  high-performance car segment. Indeed, the company posted record sales
  once again in 2021. A total of 163,542 BMW M cars were delivered to
  customers worldwide last year, a 13 percent increase on 2020.

This growth was spread equally between the High-Performance sports
  cars and Performance cars made by BMW M GmbH, with both product
  categories raising their sales figures to a new level. “This success
  is the perfect start to our anniversary year,” says Franciscus van
  Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “M is in a stronger position than ever as it
  celebrates its 50th birthday.”

The biggest drivers of growth among the High-Performance sports cars
  were the new BMW M3 and BMW M4 models introduced in spring 2021.
  Fuelled by a vehicle concept focused squarely on emotionally charged
  dynamism and unprecedented diversity in the model range, the new BMW
  M3 Sedan (fuel consumption combined: 10.2 – 10.0 l/100 km [27.7 – 28.3
  mpg imp]; CO

emissions combined: 231 – 227 g/km as per
  WLTP), new BMW M4 Coupé (fuel consumption combined: 10.1 – 9.9 l/100
  km [28.0 – 28.5 mpg imp]; CO

emissions combined:
  230 – 226 g/km as per WLTP) and new BMW M4 Convertible (fuel
  consumption combined: 10.2 l/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO

emissions combined: 233 – 231 g/km as per WLTP) got off to an
  extremely successful start. The latest model generation is the first
  to offer customers two output levels topping out at 375 kW/510 hp, the
  M xDrive all-wheel-drive system and a choice of either a six-speed
  manual gearbox or the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission.

“The response to the new generation of the BMW M3 and BMW M4 has been
  simply overwhelming,” reports Timo Resch, Vice President Customer,
  Brand and Sales at BMW M GmbH. “We can therefore expect demand for
  these iconic sports cars to continue on an upward curve in 2022.”

Also making a powerful contribution to the latest rise in
  High-Performance model sales at BMW M GmbH were the BMW X5 M
  Competition (fuel consumption combined: 13.6 – 13.3 l/100 km [20.8
  – 21,2 mpg imp]; CO

emissions combined: 308 – 303 g/km as
  per WLTP) and BMW X6 M Competition (fuel consumption combined:
  13.4 – 13.1 l/100 km [21.1 – 21.6 mpg imp]; CO

emissions
  combined: 305 – 299 g/km as per WLTP). Following the successful market
  launch of the latest model generation the previous year, the
  charismatic High-Performance sports cars in the Sports Activity
  Vehicle and Sports Activity Coupé segment – both powered by a 460
  kW/625 hp V8 engine – increased their sales figures once again in 2021.

The dynamic excellence, agility and precision for which M is renowned
  also enabled the brand’s Performance models to delight and excite a
  wide range of customers over the past year. Credit for the latest
  boost to sales goes above all to the M models based on the new BMW 4
  Series. Particularly popular were the variants of the new BMW 4 Series
  Coupé, whose line-up consists of the BMW M440i Coupé (fuel consumption
  combined: 8.1 – 7.4 l/100 km [34.8 – 38.2 mpg imp]; CO

emissions combined: 184 – 167 g/km as per WLTP) and BMW
  M440i xDrive Coupé (fuel consumption combined: 8.2 – 7.5 l/100 km
  [34.5 – 37.7 mpg imp]; CO

emissions combined:
  186 – 170 g/km as per WLTP) powered by a 275 kW/374 hp six-cylinder
  in-line petrol engine, and the BMW M440d xDrive Coupé (fuel
  consumption combined: 6.3 – 5.7 l/100 km [44.8 – 49.6 mpg imp];
  CO

emissions combined: 165 – 150 g/km as per WLTP), whose
  six-cylinder in-line diesel unit produces 250 kW/340 hp.

The latest BMW X models within the ranks of M’s Performance cars also
  proved extremely desirable. Indeed, the BMW X3 M40i powered by a
  six-cylinder in-line engine with 265 kW/360 hp (fuel consumption
  combined: 9.5 – 8.8 l/100 km [29.7 – 32.1 mpg imp]; CO

emissions combined: 216 – 199 g/km as per WLTP) and the BMW X7 M50i
  (fuel consumption combined: 12.8 – 12.3 l/100 km [22.1 – 23.0 mpg
  imp]; CO

emissions combined: 292 – 280 g/km as per WLTP)
  with its 390 kW/530 hp V8 unit both posted an increase in new registrations.

BMW M GmbH will continue its product offensive in this anniversary
  year with the addition of new High-Performance and Performance models.
  Highlights include the new BMW M240i xDrive Coupé (fuel consumption
  combined: 8.8 – 8.1 l/100 km [32.1 – 34.9 mpg imp]; CO

emissions combined: 200 – 185 g/km as per WLTP) and the arrival later
  in the year of the first BMW M3 Touring and an exclusive
  special-edition model based on the new BMW M4 Coupé.

In addition, the BMW Group subsidiary – which was founded as BMW
  Motorsport GmbH in May 1972 and enjoys the status of an independent
  manufacturer – will also drive the transformation to electric
  mobility. Following in the tyre tracks of the BMW i4 M50 (electric
  power consumption combined: 22.5 – 18.0 kWh/100 km as per WLTP;
  CO

emissions combined: 0 g/km) in the first half of 2022
  will be the likewise fully electric BMW iX M60 (projected electric
  power consumption combined: 24.7 – 21.7 kWh/100 km as per WLTP;
  CO

emissions combined: 0 g/km).

The anniversary year will be crowned by the start of production of
  the BMW XM. The most powerful BMW M car ever to go into series
  production is also the brand’s first High-Performance model to employ
  a plug-in hybrid drive system. Its newly developed M Hybrid technology
  brings together a V8 engine and a high-performance electric motor to
  develop maximum output of 550 kW/750 hp and peak torque of 1,000 Nm
  (737 lb-ft). The design of the BMW XM majors on presence and extrovert
  appeal and in so doing sends out a clear statement in the luxury segment.

“Our first standalone model since the legendary BMW M1 represents a
  complete re-imagining of the high-performance car segment,” says van
  Meel. “The BMW XM blends expressive design and progressive interior
  luxury with an incomparable driving experience that serves up both
  sublime performance and the ability to glide along in near silence in
  all-electric mode. In so doing, it provides an inimitable expression
  of poise and assurance, and at the same time points the way to the
  future of our brand.”
