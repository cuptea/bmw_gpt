+++ Ace in the first round: Daniel Gale (AUS) wins Hole-in-One car
  BMW M5 Touring +++ “This baby’s mine” – Gale predicts dream shot at
  Royal Queensland Golf Club on Wednesday +++ 2025/26 season of DP World
  Tour tees off with BMW PGA Australian Championship +++

The new season of the DP World Tour
  could not have got off to a more spectacular start. In the first round
  of the opening tournament, the BMW Australian PGA Championship at
  Royal Queensland Golf Club (Brisbane), spectators celebrated two aces.
  Daniel Gale, who pulled off the dream shot on the 11th hole (Par 3),
  was especially delighted. This is the hole on which the Hole-in-One
  prize is awarded: the new BMW M5 Touring, which launched in Australia
  this year. The BMW M5 Touring combines performance with characteristic
  design, while the plentiful space means it also impresses with its
  uncompromising suitability for everyday life. As a performance sports
  car with more than enough space for golf equipment, the BMW M5 Touring
  is the perfect hole-in-one car.

Gale, three-time winner of the Challenger PGA Tour of Australasia,
  aced the hole on the 154-metre 11th an 8 iron. After the round, the
  29-year-old said that it was a predicted shot: “I played in the pro-am
  and I said, ‘this baby's mine’ – and it actually happened so it’s
  pretty crazy. In the air it was this perfect baby draw, riding the
  wind, and landed it perfectly and it trickled in at perfect speed as well.”

Meanwhile, Kazuma Kobori sunk the first ace of the new season on the
  17th hole. He might not have been rewarded with a hole-in-one car, but
  the shot helped the New Zealander enter the BMW PGA Australian
  Championship weekend in the lead. Gale is currently in tied for
  18

place with Major winner and former world number one
  Adam Scott (AUS), and others.

This is the second edition for which BMW is title partner of the BMW
  PGA Australian Championship, the newest member of the family of BMW
  title tournaments on four continents. The other tournaments include
  the BMW PGA Championship in London (ENG), the BMW International Open
  in Munich (both on the DP World Tour), the penultimate playoff
  tournament on the PGA TOUR, the BMW Championship (USA), as well as the
  BMW Ladies Championship (LPGA Tour) in Korea. Once again a multitude
  of top players are competing at the BMW Australian PGA Championship in
  2025, including BMW Australia’s golf ambassadors Min Woo Lee and Elvis
  Smylie. They both have brilliant memories of the tournament: Min Woo
  Lee won it in 2023, Elvis Smylie was victorious last year.
