A new BMW M works driver enters the FIA WEC stage in 2026. Dan Harper
  will share the cockpit of the #69 BMW M4 GT3 EVO as Pro driver with
  Parker Thompson (CAN, Silver) and Anthony McIntosh (USA, Bronze). Both
  are also new additions to Team WRT. Three old acquaintances meet again
  in the cockpit of the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. BMW M works driver Augusto
  Farfus will line up as Pro together with Sean Gelael (INA, Silver) and
  Darren Leung (GBR, Bronze). The trio already competed together in the
  FIA WEC in the 2024 season and celebrated a number of successes - most
  notably victory at Imola (ITA) and second place on the podium at the
  24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA).

In North America, Paul Miller Racing will make another attempt to win
  the title in the GTD PRO class with the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO and a total
  of four BMW M works drivers. Connor De Phillippi and Neil Verhagen
  (both USA) will be the regular drivers. They will be supported in the
  Endurance races by Max Hesse (GER), while Dan Harper will join them in
  the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA). In the GTD category, BMW M works driver
  Robby Foley (USA) will share the cockpit with Patrick Gallagher (USA)
  as regular driver. Francis Selldorff (USA) joins them in the Endurance
  races, while BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) completes the
  quartet in the 24 Hours of Daytona.

"I'm really looking forward to driving with Sean
  and Darren again next season. We had a lot of success with this
  pairing in 2024. We are now entering our third season in the FIA WEC
  and have significantly more experience than back then. Accordingly,
  the goal is to be fully competitive and fight for the world title."

"The FIA WEC is a new racing series with new circuits for me. I'm
  extremely excited to be competing in an official FIA World
  Championship. The highlight will obviously be Le Mans. I am proud to
  have made it this far to be able to take part in this event. I have
  gained a lot of experience working with Bronze drivers over the past
  few years. My first impression of Parker and Anthony is very good.
  Together with Team WRT we will certainly have a lot of fun and form a
  strong team. Before that, I'm looking forward to returning to Daytona
  with Paul Miller Racing. It's a fantastic race and the four of us
  drivers should be strong enough to have a good chance of winning in
  our class."

"I can't wait to contest the full IMSA
  season with Paul Miller Racing in 2026. I think we have a very strong
  driver line-up, which proved last season that it can win races and
  regularly compete at the front. With Neil at my side, the goal is to
  win the first overall title for Paul Miller Racing in GTD PRO."

"I'm thrilled to be competing with Paul Miller
  Racing for my second full IMSA season. Last year I learnt a lot about
  the championship. While 2025 had a lot of good moments, there was also
  a lot to improve on. I'm looking forward to working with Connor and
  our new engineer throughout the season. I can't wait to start 2026 in
  this constellation."

"I think it's great that we have such
  consistency in the driver line-up at Turner Motorsport. I'm really
  looking forward to another year with the team in the IMSA GTD class.
  We had a very strong season in 2024 with wins and podiums and second
  place in the overall standings. Unfortunately, things didn't go so
  well in 2025. Now we want to build on the performance we showed in
  2024 in the coming season."
