BMW and MINI will be hosting
  attention-grabbing stands at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Taking to
  the stage in Tokyo on 31 October – 9 November will be a host of
  future-focused BMW and MINI models and technologies, including the
  first new Neue Klasse model BMW iX3, hydrogen fuel cell technology,
  the MINI family including new MINI Paul Smith Edition, the
  special-edition BMW M2 CS* and the BMW Concept Speedtop concept car.
  BMW Motorrad will also be represented at the event – in the form of
  the fully electric BMW CE 02 and the BMW M 1000 RR ridden by Toprak
  Razgatlıoğlu to his second successive FIM Superbike World Championship
  crown in 2025. On 29 and 30 October, representatives of the
  international media will have an early opportunity to take in the
  compelling exhibits from the three brands at the 1,100-square-metre
  stand in Tokyo’s Big Sight exhibition centre. Visitors to the show can
  also experience in-car gaming with AirConsole, which is making its
  debut with BMW Operating System 8.5. The new BMW iX3 will be among the
  vehicles offering customers this function, which brings with it
  world-renowned titles such as UNO® Car Party!, Hot Wheels: Xtreme
  Overdrive

and PAC-MAN

Championship Edition.

The Japan Mobility Show will host the Asian premiere of the first new
  Neue Klasse model: the BMW iX3. Lining up alongside the iX3 will be
  revolutionary technologies that point the way to the future of the BMW
  Group as a whole. Visitors to the Japan Mobility Show will see the new
  BMW iX3 reveal technological leaps forward in a host of different
  areas: electric mobility, display and control/operation concept,
  digitalisation, connectivity, design and sustainability. All future
  BMW models will benefit from the innovations brought by the Neue
  Klasse – regardless of the type of drive system they use.

Production of the BMW iX3 for Japan is scheduled to begin in March
  2026, with sales through the Japanese BMW dealer network currently due
  to begin in the second half of 2026. The BMW iX3 launches an all-new
  design language for the BMW brand that faithfully conveys the
  technological advances achieved. The revolutionary display and
  control/operation concept BMW Panoramic iDrive with the new BMW
  Panoramic Vision and new BMW Operating System X redefines the user
  experience and creates flawless driver orientation in the BMW mould.
  The zonal electronics architecture featuring four high-performance
  computers – the “superbrains” – provides the basis for the
  software-defined vehicle. One of these high-performance computers is
  the Heart of Joy: with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software
  developed fully in-house, it can manage the driving characteristics of
  the overall vehicle from a standstill to the dynamic limit. As the
  first new Neue Klasse model – with sixth-generation (Gen6) BMW eDrive,
  cylindrical-cell battery and new electric motors – the new BMW iX3
  embodies major technological progress. A maximum charging rate of 400
  kW enables 372 km (231 miles) of range to be added in ten minutes, and
  bidirectional charging functions turn the car into a powerbank on wheels.

Product diversity continues to be a key success factor for the BMW
  Group. A wide-ranging portfolio of drive systems – encompassing
  internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric drive
  systems and, starting with the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen in 2028, hydrogen
  fuel cell technology – lays the foundations for successfully meeting
  the varying demands and needs of customers worldwide both now and in
  the future.

The hydrogen drive technology is based on the third-generation fuel
  cell system that the BMW Group is developing in collaboration with the
  Toyota Motor Corporation. This technological advance paves the way for
  a system with a more compact design that is also more powerful and
  efficient, thereby increasing range and output at the same time as
  reducing energy consumption. Competence centres in Munich and at BMW
  Group Plant Steyr are building initial prototypes for this technology.
  And BMW Group Plant Landshut is supplying additional components for
  the drive system.

Back in 1998, Paul Smith lent his signature to a limited-run edition
  of the classic Mini. And MINI and the British designer have since
  linked up to bring a number of other projects to fruition. Fast
  forward to the present day and the Japan Mobility Show 2025 will
  provide the setting for the latest milestone in this tradition-steeped
  collaboration: the world premiere of the new MINI Paul Smith Edition.
  For this special-edition car, Paul Smith brings his world-renowned
  “classic with a twist” design language to the MINI Cooper family. The
  styling and details of the cars bring together the unmistakable style
  of Paul Smith with the playful, upbeat and independent spirit of the
  MINI brand.

Exclusive exterior colours such as Nottingham Green and sophisticated
  design elements like the Paul Smith “signature stripe” accentuate the
  distinctive looks of the MINI Paul Smith Edition. Standard
  specification for the MINI Paul Smith Edition includes 18-inch Night
  Flash Spoke black alloy wheels with accents in Dark Steel. And a Paul
  Smith signature on the wheel trims and black horizontal boot lid
  handle marks out the special-edition cars. The MINI Paul Smith Edition
  will be offered for the MINI Cooper 3-Door, 5-Door and MINI Cooper
  Convertible models. Worldwide sales of the fully electric variants of
  the MINI Paul Smith Edition will get underway with the world premiere
  at the Japan Mobility Show, while orders for variants with an internal
  combustion engine will open in the first quarter of 2026.

The special-edition BMW M2 CS is celebrating its Japanese premiere at
  the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Its high-revving
  six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinTurbo technology – an upgraded
  version of the unit found in the standard M2 – develops an impressive
  390 kW/530 hp at 6,250 rpm. In so doing, the compact high-performance
  sports car from BMW M GmbH raises the bar for undiluted driving
  pleasure a notch higher still.

The standard-fitted eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with
  Drivelogic sends the engine’s power to the rear wheels of the BMW M2
  CS. Judicious application of lightweight design techniques including
  the use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) reduces the weight
  of the special edition by around 30 kilograms compared to the standard
  M2. Thanks to the car’s lighter weight and lightning-fast power
  delivery, the BMW M2 CS is able to break the four-second barrier for
  the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) with a time of 3.8 seconds. The
  figure calculated using the “1-foot rollout” method** is 3.5 seconds.
  The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 3.4
  seconds and top speed is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph).
  The chassis technology and braking system of the BMW M2 CS are
  precisely tailored to the uprated performance characteristics of the
  engine and the specific weight balance of the special edition, which
  has an eight-millimetre-lower ride height.

The striking exterior of the BMW M2 CS is headlined by a host of
  components made from CFRP and exclusive details such as the M exterior
  mirror caps familiar from the BMW M2*, the M Carbon roof – which comes
  as standard on the special-edition model – and the CS-specific rear
  diffusor. The interior of the new BMW M2 CS combines an exclusive look
  with the sporty feel of exquisite Alcantara and innovative lightweight
  design, examples of which include the CFRP centre console and the
  weight-optimised, heated M Carbon front bucket seats finished in
  Merino leather.

Visitors to the BMW Group stand in Tokyo can also experience in-car
  gaming via AirConsole, as introduced for the first time with BMW
  Operating System 8.5. The new BMW iX3 will offer this feature, which
  comes with world-renowned titles like the classic card game UNO® from
  Mattel – here tailored for in-car gaming and renamed “UNO® Car
  Party!”. Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) is a leading global toy and family
  entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand
  portfolios in the world.

BMW customers also gain exclusive access to the Hot Wheels: Xtreme
  Overdrive

game that AirConsole – in collaboration with
  Mattel – has added to its game library. In this game, players can earn
  points with the virtual BMW Vision Neue Klasse X in races on the
  Panoramic Drive Track, unlock legendary Hot Wheels cars and customize
  them. This makes every race a showcase for the performance and style
  of the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X.

At the same time, AirConsole will also release PAC-MAN™ Championship
  Edition from Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. to BMW for the first
  time. This brand-specific version of the arcade classic has been
  customized with exclusive BMW items, bringing a unique twist to one of
  the world’s best known games. AirConsole allows customers to use their
  smartphones as controllers so that all the passengers on board can
  play against each other.

Adding a particularly exclusive head-turner to the vehicles on
  display at the BMW Group’s Japan Mobility Show 2025 stand is the
  unique BMW Concept Speedtop. This three-door concept car was unveiled
  for the first time in May this year at the Concorso d´Eleganza Villa
  d´Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the
  shores of Lake Como in Italy. The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the
  sporty Touring model type, blending the elegance of a shooting brake
  with a fresh design language. The exclusivity of the BMW Concept
  Speedtop (which will be offered in a strictly limited-run small series
  of 70 cars) is underscored by its exquisite engine – the most powerful
  V8 engine currently offered by BMW.

The exterior of the BMW Concept Speedtop is marked out by the
  pronounced V-shape of the “shark-nose” front end, the slim front
  lights and the illuminated kidneys. The continuation of the central
  spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler imbues the
  car with a dynamic Touring profile, its broad haunches further
  enriching the athletic design. And its elegance is underscored by
  two-tone, 14-spoke fan-style wheels, which have been designed
  specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop. A two-tone colour and
  materials concept creates a connection between the exterior and
  interior. The sparkling brown tones of the Floating Sunstone Maroon
  exterior paint finish are carried over into the cabin in the form of
  the brown Sundown Maroon colour world with the light Moonstone White
  of the seats. In addition, skilfully crafted, traditional brogue-style
  details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and visualise the
  manufactory-level craftsmanship on display. The boot of the BMW
  Concept Speedtop is also leather-covered and adorned with brogue-style
  perforations. The elaborate craftsmanship of the exterior and interior
  was realised with the expertise of the Manufactory workshop at BMW
  Group Plant Dingolfing.

The BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge concept car presented at the Japan Mobility
  Show embodies the elegant symbiosis of luxurious driving comfort and
  traditional Japanese craftsmanship. With space for up to seven people,
  this attractive concept model based on the BMW X7 also offers high
  practicality. A tranquil space filled with beauty, where stars
  twinkle, the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge creates a gentle, expansive
  sanctuary. Here in the cabin, the refined brilliance of BMW's
  exclusive appointments is artistically combined with the vast expanse
  of a starry sky, crafted using traditional Kyoto techniques.

A dedicated two-tone paint scheme instantly conveys the exclusive
  aura of the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge. Complementing the main colour BMW
  Individual Velvet Blue, the roof section is painted in Space Silver to
  evoke the shimmer of nebulae shining in the cosmos. The Crystal Light
  Headlights emit an infinite, jewel-like brilliance, enhanced by gentle
  Iconic Glow light. The interior features a Panoramic Skyroof with
  15,000 LEDs projecting a pale blue starlight at night, while the
  Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System expresses the light
  shining on the earth through sound.
