The BMW Group continues to systematically
  reduce its fleet-wide CO

emissions and is making an
  important contribution to realising its ambitious CO

reduction targets for the whole group.

Based on preliminary internal calculations, the BMW Group’s EU
  fleet-wide emissions came in at 102.1 grams per kilometre (WLTP) for
  2023 (2022: 105 grams per kilometre). This represents a reduction of
  2.8 percent from the previous year. The BMW Group also outperformed
  the applicable fleet target limit for the company set by the European
  Union EU27+2 (EU, Norway, Iceland) of 128.5 grams per kilometre by
  26.4 grams in 2023.

Implementation of the BMW Group’s electrification strategy is a key
  driver for its continuing efforts to reduce fleet-wide emissions.  In
  2023, the company sold a total of 376,183 fully-electric vehicles
  worldwide – 74.4% more than in 2022. The BMW Group’s sales growth for
  fully-electric vehicles in 2023 therefore outpaced growth in the total
  BEV market.

With more than 15  fully-electric models in its line-up, the BMW
  Group aims to continue its successful BEV growth in 2024. One in five
  of the company’s newly delivered vehicles should have a fully-electric
  drive train this year; by 2025, it should be one in four.

In addition to increasing electrification of the BMW Group fleet,
  continuous further development of conventional drive trains also
  helped lower CO

emissions. The latest update to the drive
  train kit has further boosted the efficiency of internal combustion
  engines, especially since autumn 2022.

The BMW Group views continuous emissions reduction across its vehicle
  fleet as an integral part of its sustainability strategy. By 2030, the
  company plans to reduce its total CO

emissions by at least
  40 percent per vehicle from 2019 levels. The aim is to achieve this
  throughout the entire value chain – from the supply chain to
  production to the use phase. The BMW Group plans to be climate-neutral
  no later than 2050.

With these objectives, the BMW Group is pursuing a path that is in
  line with the Paris climate goal for limiting global warming. The
  company is the first German automotive manufacturer to join the
  “Business Ambition for 1.5° C” campaign launched by the Science-Based
  Targets Initiative and also part of the United Nations’ international
  Race to Zero campaign.

The delivery figures reported in this press release are provisional
  and may change up until the BMW Group Report 2023 is published.
