  stars and shots to remember: tournament highlights +++ An overview of
  the facts & figures +++

Three and a half decades of world-class golf,
  sheer driving pleasure, fantastic atmospheres, and an entertaining
  fringe programme: the BMW International Open at the BMW Group’s home
  in Munich is an institution in German-speaking countries – and beyond:
  no other tournament on the DP World Tour has taken place continuously
  for longer, with the same name and same title partner.

However, BMW is not only title partner, but also the organiser of the
  BMW International Open – and that is all the more remarkable, as it is
  not something you come across every day. That was the case when the
  tournament was held for the first time back in 1989. It was also the
  BMW Group’s first involvement in professional golf. Ahead of the
  35

BMW International Open (3

to
  7

July 2024, Golfclub München Eichenried), we look back
  at the highlights from across the tournament’s long history.

The winner of the inaugural tournament was Northern Irishman David
  Feherty. Right from the very first BMW International Open, a
  Hole-in-One Car has already been up for grabs for the first person to
  high an ace on a certain par 3. Kicking off this tradition was the BMW
  325iX Touring. It did not take long for that car to find a lucky
  owner: American Jay Townsend won a BMW 325i Cabrio in 1991.

The next premiere for the fledgling tournament came just one year
  later: Paul Azinger became the first player to win the BMW
  International Open twice, having previously done so in 1990. To this
  date, the American remains the record champion, alongside Thomas Bjørn
  (Denmark, 2000 & 2002), Pablo Larrazábal (Spain, 1991 & 1995)
  and Henrik Stenson (Sweden, 2006 & 2016).

The players have been striving fruitlessly to break another record
  for more than two decades: the -27 (261 shots) set by none other than
  John Daly (USA) in 2001 remains undefeated. In that same year, the
  Hole-in-One Award was won for the second time: Raphaël Jacquelin from
  France was delighted to receive the legendary Roadster BMW Z8 – the
  very model that Pierce Brosnan drove to Hollywood fame in “James Bond
  007 – The World Is Not Enough”.

Despite the tournament’s long history, there has only ever been one
  homegrown winner: in 2008, as the BMW International Open celebrated
  its 20

anniversary, Martin Kaymer triumphed in Munich. He
  was just 23 years and 177 days old at the time, and the two-time major
  champion remains the youngest winner of the tournament to this day.
  However, Kaymer is far from the only major winner to have raised the
  trophy aloft at Germany’s most iconic tournament. Azinger, Sandy Lyle
  (Scotland, 1991), Daly, Stenson and Ernie Els (South Africa, 2013)
  complete this list. Other illustrious names to have been engraved on
  the BMW International Open trophy include Colin Montgomerie (Scotland,
  1999), Lee Westwood (2003) and Viktor Hovland (Norway, 2021).

Hovland was also victorious at last year’s BMW Championship on his
  way to winning the FedExCup on the PGA TOUR. The only other player
  with two different BMW titles to his name is David Howell (England,
  BMW International Open 2005 and BMW PGA Championship 2006). As is so
  often the case, however, one person can trump even that: Miguel Ángel
  Jiménez. The irrepressible and inimitable Spaniard has three BMW
  trophies in his cabinet at home: the 2004 BMW International Open, the
  2008 BMW PGA Championship, and the 2004 BMW Asian Open, which is no
  longer played.

The list of players with a BMW Hole-in-One car in their garage was a
  short one for a while. After Jacquelin in 2001, it took nine years for
  another player to ace their way to sheer driving pleasure. Once again,
  it was a Frenchman: Jean-François Lucquin was the delighted recipient
  of a BMW 535i in 2010. That seemed to open the floodgates. Andrew
  Marshall from England was next, winning a BMW 640i Gran Coupé in 2012.
  Two years later, an electrified car found a new owner for the first
  time, when Englishman James Heath was rewarded for his dream shot with
  a BMW i8. Richie Ramsay from Scotland (2016, BMW M760Li xDrive),
  England’s Aaron Rai (2018, BMW i8 Roadster) and Indian Gaganjeet
  Bhullar (2019, BMW M8 Competition Coupé) took the number of
  Hole-in-One Cars won to eight.

Last year, children and youngsters were among the winners at the BMW
  International Open, as the “Eagles for Education” initiative made its
  debut. For each eagle carded during the tournament, the BMW Group
  donated € 1,000 to education projects and rounded the total amount up
  to € 99,000. “Eagles for Education” returns this year to help achieve
  educational equity and equal opportunity in Munich.
