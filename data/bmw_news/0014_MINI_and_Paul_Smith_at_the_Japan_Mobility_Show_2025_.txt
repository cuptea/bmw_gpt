The Japan Mobility Show 2025 becomes
  the stage for the latest milestone in the long-standing collaboration
  between MINI and British designer Paul Smith. It will be unveiled as
  part of the BMW Group Keynote on 29 October 2025 at 09:55 (JST) at the
  BMW Group stand, based in the West Exhibition Hall of the show.

The MINI Paul Smith Edition is a new chapter in the success story of
  the two British brands. The long-lasting relationship began in 1998,
  when the designer wrapped a Classic Mini Cooper in his trademark
  visual design. To mark the 40th anniversary of the Classic Mini in
  1999, the designer lent his characteristic Paul Smith "Signature
  Stripe" to a one-off model. After two further one-offs - the MINI
  Strip in 2021 and the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith in 2022 - Paul
  Smith's design language returns to MINI.

As part of the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show, MINI is
  presenting the diverse range of its current product portfolio. The
  MINI Cooper family is represented by showcasing the MINI Cooper SE,
  which combines heritage, technology and driving pleasure. Whilst
  providing a fully electric go-kart feeling via the 218 hp electric
  powertrain. Also present will be the MINI Cooper 5-door S, which
  combines compact dimensions and agility whilst showcasing increased
  practicality when compared to its 3-door siblings. A MINI Cooper
  Convertible will also be on show, which presents open-air driving in
  the spirit of its ‘Always Open’ philosophy: agile, spontaneous and
  full of driving pleasure.Launched earlier this year, the MINI John
  Cooper Works Aceman outlines its sporty all-electric useable
  performance from the John Cooper Works sub-brand. The latest model in
  the MINI family presents itself as a versatile companion and not only
  demonstrates MINIs typical "Clever Use of Space" - but also
  brings a powerful driving experience to the road as a
  performance-enhanced version thanks to 258 hp produced from the 54.2
  kWh electric battery. Finally, the MINI Countryman S ALL 4 will also
  be present on the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show: as the
  largest of the MINI family, the car offers generous space and fits in
  perfectly for those looking for longer adventures and spontaneous exploring.

The Japan Mobility Show is regarded as one of the most important
  international platforms for pioneering mobility concepts. From October
  29 to November 9, over 130 exhibitors will be presenting their
  innovations to visitors and press at the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition
  centre - making the Japanese capital the centre for visions of
  tomorrow's mobility.
