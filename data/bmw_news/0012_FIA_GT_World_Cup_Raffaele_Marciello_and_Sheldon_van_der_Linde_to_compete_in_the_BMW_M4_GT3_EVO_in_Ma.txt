In 2024, Marciello celebrated victory in the qualification race
  during his Macau debut as a BMW M works driver. However, in the
  rain-affected main race, he retired while battling for the win.
  Marciello has earned his reputation as a Macau specialist through his
  triumphs in 2019 and 2023. This year, his BMW M4 GT3 EVO will be
  fielded by ROWE Racing. The new identity design debuts a revised
  colour scheme, replacing the previous white, yellow, and grey with
  white, red, and black.

Van der Linde also competed in 2024 with a special Shell livery – and
  it brought him luck. In his second Macau appearance, he secured his
  first podium finish by taking third place in the main race. He now
  aims to improve on this record during his third outing in Macau, once
  again teaming up with WRT.

"After
  the bitter main race last year, we still have unfinished business with
  the FIA GT World Cup. Our BMW M4 GT3 was very strong on the Guia
  Circuit in 2024 but missed out on the main race victory due to
  external circumstances. This year, we aim to claim that win with the
  EVO version of our GT car. With Raffaele Marciello and Sheldon van der
  Linde, we have two drivers who have repeatedly proved their class at
  this street race in recent years. Add to that two experienced teams,
  and we have created the best possible conditions for the next BMW M
  Motorsport victory in the Main Race since 2018."

: "I’m really excited to
  return to Macau. It’s one of the best races of the year, and the track
  is fantastic. This year, we have a new qualifying format with a
  Superpole, which will be very interesting. Together with ROWE Racing,
  I’ve had some very strong performances this season, so I’m happy to be
  back with this great team. Last year, we came close to victory. This
  time, we’ll give it our all to stand on the top step of the podium."

"I love this race and
  definitely want to keep coming back until I win it. That’s one of my
  big goals. We’ve been strong over the past two years and made it to
  the podium in 2024. I want to build on that momentum together with
  Team WRT. We work very well together, and hopefully, we can be serious
  contenders for the win. This will be my third start in Macau – and as
  they say, third time’s the charm."
