--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At its second race outing, the new BMW M Hybrid V8 claimed its maiden podium result. At the Twelve Hours of Sebring (USA), round two of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, final-stint driver Nick Yelloly (GBR) crossed the line for BMW M Team RLL in second.

Their team-mates Philipp Eng (AUT), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Marco
  Wittmann (GER) were also fighting for a top result in their #24 car.
  However, the trio had to retire due to a technical issue.

The #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 consistently worked its way up after starting
  from eighth on the grid. In the second half of the race, De Phillippi,
  Yelloly and van der Linde established themselves at the front end of
  the field. With one and a half hours to go, an unscheduled brake
  change dropped the car out of the lead lap. Yelloly successfully
  fought his way back up afterwards, taking the chequered flag in second
  following a chaotic final minutes of the race.

The #24 car was running within the top group of the GTP field for the
  opening hours. Shortly after the halfway point, the BMW M Hybrid V8
  had to be brought to the garage due to a technical issue and was retired.

In the GTD class, BMW M Motorsport team Paul Miller Racing claimed
  its first win of the season with the #1 BMW M4 GT3. Bryan Sellers,
  Madison Snow and Corey Lewis (all USA) emerged victorious after a
  strong race performance. Only 1.532 seconds behind the winners, Robby
  Foley (USA) brought the #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3 home in
  second. He had shared the car with Patrick Gallagher and Michael Dinan
  (all USA). The #95 Turner Motorsport sister car, driven by Chandler
  Hull, Bill Auberlen and John Edwards (all USA), finished seventh in
  the GTD PRO class.

The first race of the Sebring week for the BMW M Motorsport teams had
  already taken place on Thursday, round two of the 2023 IMSA Michelin
  Pilot Challenge (IMPC). The two hour race ended with a one-two finish
  for the two new Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT4s. In an exciting race,
  the two cars made it to the very top courtesy of a perfect strategy
  and outstanding performances of the drivers. Victory went to the #96
  BMW M4 GT4 of Foley and Vin Barletta (USA). The car featured the
  special split ‘Zebring‘ livery again this year as in 2021 for the
  Sebring race, in collaboration with BMW M Sim Racing Team
  BS+COMPETITION. Some of the virtual racing team’s drivers followed the
  race on site and celebrated with their colleagues from real-life
  motorsports. Robert Megennis and Cameron Lawrence (both USA) completed
  the Turner Motorsport double success, crossing the line in second in
  the #95 BMW M4 GT4. Sean Quinlan and Greg Liefooghe (both USA)
  finished ninth in the #43 BMW M4 GT4 of Stephen Cameron Racing.

“Big
  congrats on this fantastic podium. I am very proud of all the work
  being done by everyone involved in this still very young project.
  After the debut of our BMW M Hybrid V8 cars at Daytona in January,
  there was no time to rest and we can see the progress that has been
  made here at Sebring. This podium was only the next step and I am
  confident that we will continue our way towards the top with our
  brand-new BMW M prototype. I want to thank everyone at BMW M
  Motorsport and BMW M Team RLL for their great efforts and fantastic
  work, as well as our BMW M works drivers who once more convinced with
  a flawless and strong performance. Our BMW M Motorsport teams in the
  GTD classes also had an outstanding race with the one-two for the BMW
  M4 GT3s of Paul Miller Racing and Turner Motorsport. Now we are
  looking forward to the next round at Long Beach in mid-April. I also
  want to congratulate Turner Motorsport on their great one-two finish
  with the brand-new BMW M4 GT4 in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge on
  Thursday. That proved that our latest customer racing car has all the
  ingredients for success.”

“It’s
  fantastic that we were able to score our maiden podium with the new
  BMW M Hybrid V8 in only its second race. In combination with the
  one-two finish of our BMW M4 GT3 teams in the GTD class, this was an
  almost perfect outcome of a 12-hour race that ended in chaotic
  fashion. We appeared clearly stronger with our two BMW M Hybrid V8
  cars than at the Daytona season opener. Thanks to the hard work in
  Munich and at BMW M Team RLL in Indianapolis, we are gradually getting
  closer to the performance level that we want to achieve. Therefore,
  this second place scored by our #25 car is a great motivation for us
  to continue in the same fashion in the coming weeks and months.
  Congratulations to the winning Cadillac team. The retirement of our
  second car was unfortunate. There was a problem with the cooling
  system. In the GTD class, our customer teams Paul Miller Racing and
  Turner Motorsport were able to celebrate an amazing one-two finish –
  thanks to great strategies and flawless performances from their
  drivers. On Thursday, Turner Motorsport had claimed the maiden win in
  the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge for the new BMW M4 GT4, also
  securing a one-two. Congrats to Will Turner and his squad. Now we are
  fired up for the upcoming races of the 2023 IMSA season.”

“Sebring
  can be a crazy race – and we saw that tonight. I am really proud of
  the team, the steps we have made since Daytona have been obvious. I am
  also really proud of our relationship with BMW M Motorsport. Everyone
  is working really hard together. All day long we were competitive.
  We’ve had some up and downs, like the others, but in the end we
  prevailed. I am just really, really pleased.”

“I am so happy about our first podium with this
  programme. The guys and girls have worked so hard for this. We deserve
  it. We were there at the end, just as we said. That’s what this race
  is all about. In the past, we lost this race from the lead from a
  crash – this time luck was on our side. I am just super happy for
  everyone. P2 is something we can build on and start fighting forward
  for the rest of the season.”

“It’s a really nice feeling. For BMW M Team RLL and BMW M
  Motorsport to take this step is huge, i am obviously just very, very
  happy for everyone here and back in Munich. It has been many hard
  months of work and to reward them with some silverware is very nice.
  We’ve made a good step forward as well. With the general performance
  we are not quite there yet, but we have shown that we can make a good
  step. For Long Beach we will hopefully make another one.”

“This podium was very unexpected. We were
  disappointed when the brake issue occurred with one and a half hours
  to go but then everything turned around. I am super excited to be on
  the podium. The guys really deserved it after so much work during the
  off-season to make this programme a success. I can’t thank everyone
  enough. The car has made some really good steps forward.”

“Of course it is very disappointing to end the race after six
  hours but  we have to take the positives. We have shown here that hard
  work is paying off. BMW M Team RLL and BMW M Motorsport together have
  managed to improve the car a lot after Daytona. And we were on the
  hunt. Maybe we would not have won the race, but we were running at the
  front for a certain time. That shows that we have considerably closed
  the gap. There’s still work to do, we still need to improve but I
  think, even if we did not finish the race, the positives are greater
  than the negatives. Most of all because of the great second-place
  finish of our sister car.”

“It’s great to get another win here at Sebring.
  Bryan, Corey and I have won here together before – and it’s fantastic
  to do it again. The car went 12 hours without any issue and the yellow
  at the end was great because we did not have to push. In the last
  three minutes of the race it was just go, go, go!”

“It definitely was not what we were expecting but I
  think that’s what so great about IMSA racing. Anything can happen.
  With three hours to go, I don’t think anyone thought we were in
  contention of a podium finish but the team did a fantastic job with
  race strategy which kept us on the lead lap. We had issues, but Robby
  and Patrick both had a fantastic drive. Robby was amazing when he
  passed for second. The fuel saving, the team strategy, it all led to
  this result. It definitely feels really good to get onto the podium here!”
