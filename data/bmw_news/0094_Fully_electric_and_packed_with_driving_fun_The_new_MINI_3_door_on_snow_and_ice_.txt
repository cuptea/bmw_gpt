The new MINI family is doing its warm-up laps
  - and that works best on ice and snow in the bitter cold of the Arctic
  Circle. The new MINI is currently undergoing its driving dynamics
  tests at the BMW Group's winter test centre in Arjeplog, Sweden. The
  new edition of the MINI is fully electric and is now completing a
  major chapter in its series development process with the winter
  testing in Sweden. The electric drivetrain, high-voltage battery,
  power electronics and charging technology of the prototypes are
  already demonstrating their high degree of maturity at extreme
  temperatures below freezing. Snow-covered roads and specially prepared
  areas on frozen lakes also serve as ideal test tracks on which the
  characteristics of the drive, steering and chassis can be very
  sensitively tested, refined and harmonised with each other.

MINI is launching its fifth generation with the MINI 3-door as the
  first model of the new MINI family once again. With its vehicle
  concept geared to fully electric driving fun from the outset, the new
  edition of the original is ideally suited to deliver inspiring
  hallmark MINI agility and the creative use of space, which guarantees
  plenty of room inside and a small footprint.

The new MINI 3-door is supplemented in the new MINI family by the
  successor to the current MINI Countryman. The new edition of the top
  seller in the premium compact segment will be offered with both an
  internal combustion engine and a fully electric drive. Still this
  year, MINI will present the concept study of a crossover model for the
  premium small car segment.

“MINI is on a path of growth and heading towards a fully electric
  future. Our iconic MINI 3-door, maximises the experience for our
  customers through its electrified go-kart feeling combined with
  digitalised touchpoints - and a clear focus on sustainability with a
  minimal environmental footprint." says Stefanie Wurst, Head of
  the MINI brand.

The new MINI 3-door consistently continues the concept of urban
  driving fun that has been successful for more than 60 years. This will
  be implemented even more puristically and sustainably in the future.
  This becomes particularly clear in the design of the classic body
  variant. Electrification offers designers the opportunity to think
  fundamentally differently and creates new starting points for the
  hallmark MINI combination of individual style, attention to detail, a
  sense of tradition and a passion for innovation. The design of the new
  MINI harks back to its unique history, uses the latest technology and
  creates a maximum of emotions combined with a minimal footprint.

The inspiring driving characteristics of the new MINI 3-door can be
  optimally refined at the winter test centre in Arjeplog. With every
  lap it completes on packed snow and ice, the test engineers can
  precisely tune the spontaneous power development of the electric
  motor, the control systems for optimising traction, the cornering
  behaviour, the suspension and damping characteristics as well as the
  character of the steering and braking system. The integrated
  application of all drive and chassis systems enables a mature degree
  of overall harmony, which will help the later production model to
  deliver a coherent and hallmark MINI balance of go-kart feeling and
  driving comfort.
