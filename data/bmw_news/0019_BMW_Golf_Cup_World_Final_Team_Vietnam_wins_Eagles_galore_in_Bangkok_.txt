At the end of an unforgettable week at the
  BMW Golf Cup World Final in Bangkok (Thailand), there were only
  beaming faces to be seen at the concluding gala dinner. Among the
  winners of the largest international tournament series for amateur
  golfers were special guests Colin Montgomerie (SCO) and Fanny Sunesson
  (SWE), and all finalists from 38 countries and regions who had the
  privilege to enjoy this ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ experience – and
  contributed to a record result. The representatives of UNICEF Thailand
  also had every reason to smile. A remarkable number of 116 net eagles
  were recorded during the tournament. This means that the BMW Group,
  just during the World Final, supports the UN agency for children,
  UNICEF*, with 116,000 euros, helping to provide education to young
  people and thus enabling them to lead self-determined lives.

“It was our great pleasure to welcome golf enthusiasts from all over
  the world to Thailand and the beautiful capital of Bangkok. At the end
  of an unforgettable week, it is time to acknowledge the performance of
  Team Vietnam and the individual winners. Congratulations on the BMW
  Golf Cup World Final titles,” said Rene Gerhard, President and CEO,
  BMW Group Thailand. “Competitions need winners, but there is so much
  more to the World Final. A palpable sense of community that has
  developed across all the cultures and nationalities, the shared joy of
  golf and the delight generated by such a fantastic event will be
  remembered forever. Last but not least, the 116,000 euro to UNICEF and
  our joint initiative ‘BRIDGE’ will help to growth educational equality
  and therefore prosperity and social stability here in Thailand.”

The sporting part of the World Final, held for the first time in
  Thailand's capital, Bangkok, took place at the spectacular Alpine Golf
  Club and consisted of three rounds in three individual categories: Men
  1 (up to HCP 12), Men 2 (HCP 13-28), and Ladies (HCP up to 28).
  Additionally, a National Team Category was compiled from the
  individual results. Team Vietnam emerged victorious with 302 net
  points, ahead of teams from China (297) and Japan (291). In the Ladies
  category, the title also went to Vietnam which Thi Quynh Nhu Nguyen
  (100) won ahead of Daniela Antillon Goñi (MEX, 97) and Akiko Wakamatsu
  (JPN, 96). The Chinese players Yong Zhang (104) and Lei Shi (101)
  celebrated a 1-2 result in the Men 1 category, followed by Quang Duong
  Ta (101) from Vietnam. In the Men 2 category, Suet Lung Leung (HKG,
  105) triumphed ahead of Hamza Chraibi (MAR, 104) and Kyle Justin Tan
  (PHI, 104).

The trophies were presented to the winners at the concluding gala
  dinner by Scottish golf and Ryder Cup legend Colin Montgomerie. “I am
  very grateful to having been part of the BMW Golf Cup World Final. BMW
  golf events are second to none and I always enjoy them a lot,” said
  Montgomerie. “The World Final is like no other and gives the
  participants the very same treatment of a professional top event, a
  truly unique experience. Most of all, I wholeheartedly love to see
  that this event celebrates the best in our beautiful game:
  competitiveness and ambition, but also respect for one another, and
  sharing of joyful moments across cultural and national boundaries.”

In addition to experiencing the many attractions of Bangkok and the
  rich Thai culture, these moments included exclusive evening events and
  another special guest as Sweden’s Fanny Sunesson accompanied the World
  Final from the first to the last day. She not only charmed the players
  and guests with her warm personality but also shared her extensive
  experience as a former caddie for some of the world's best golfers,
  such as Sir Nick Faldo (ENG) and Adam Scott (AUS).

“Eagles for Education” is the slogan of the BMW Group’s educational
  initiative in golf. The company makes use of numerous BMW title
  tournaments around the world to fulfil its responsibility as a
  corporate citizen and to participate in solutions to social
  challenges. For the second time since 2024, this happened at the World
  Final through the support of the cooperation between the BMW Group and
  UNICEF, which is named “BRIDGE. Educating young people for tomorrow,
  today." The focus of the partnership is to bridge learning gaps
  within society and create learning and education opportunities in
  science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) – because STEM
  professions are particularly important given that they are the engine
  of global economic growth.

The list of countries where the BMW Group and UNICEF are working
  together includes South Africa (venue for the BMW Golf Cup World Final
  last year), Brazil, India, Mexico and Thailand, the host country for
  this year’s BMW Golf Cup World Final – all countries which have BMW
  Group presence.
