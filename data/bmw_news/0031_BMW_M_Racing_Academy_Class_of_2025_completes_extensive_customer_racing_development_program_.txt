To conclude their BMW M Racing Academy year, the four members of the
  “Class of 2025” spent a full week immersed in the world of BMW M
  Motorsport. At BMW’s headquarters in Munich (GER), Besler, Martí,
  Million, and Tröger enjoyed a guided tour of BMW Welt and the BMW
  Museum. They then participated in workshops on social media and brand
  building – and immediately put their new skills to the test: the group
  documented their joint road trip to Viareggio (ITA) in a BMW M5 for
  BMW M Motorsport’s official Instagram channel.

In Viareggio, the quartet once again trained with Formula Medicine –
  as they had at the beginning of the year – focusing on both their
  mental and physical performance. Under the professional supervision of
  Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his globally renowned team, the
  participants assessed their progress since the program’s start and
  evaluated their development. The “Class of 2025” also completed a
  24-hour race simulation together, gaining firsthand experience of the
  procedures, challenges, and demands of endurance racing.

Throughout the year, the four drivers accumulated many valuable test
  kilometers on real racetracks. In Miramas (FRA) and Varano (ITA), they
  worked side by side with BMW M works drivers on development testing
  for the new BMW M2 Racing. Martí and Besler also gained insights into
  BMW M Motorsport’s factory programs by attending the FIA WEC weekend
  in Imola (ITA), where they met Head of BMW M Motorsport, Andreas Roos
  and several works drivers. Meanwhile, Million joined BMW M Motorsport
  at the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship round in Laguna Seca (USA).

The participants were mentored throughout the year by a trio of BMW M
  works drivers. Jens Klingmann (GER) served as the main point of
  contact for the “Class of 2025,” supported by Max Hesse (GER) and
  Robby Foley (USA). The team was completed by Dirk Adorf (GER), who
  brought his extensive experience from previous talent development
  programs. Together, they provided expert guidance both on and off the
  track, offering invaluable advice, analysis, and feedback. Their
  presence at the participants’ GT4 customer racing events provided an
  especially valuable learning opportunity through direct, hands-on coaching.

Besler, Martí, Tröger, and Million had earned their places in the
  Academy after a demanding selection process against a strong field of
  GT4 drivers last year. The selection for the second generation is
  already underway – and following the program’s successful debut,
  everyone involved is eagerly looking forward to the “Class of 2026.”

“I’m extremely proud that we were able to establish this
  development program again this year. Supporting talent from the
  customer racing sector is something both BMW M Motorsport and I
  personally care deeply about. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, the four
  participants made important contributions to development work,
  benefitting everyone involved. It was fascinating to watch how our
  ‘Class of 2025’ evolved both on and off the track. My thanks go to our
  BMW M works drivers Jens, Max, and Robby for their intense and
  constructive mentoring, which makes this program so special. We’re all
  very eager to continue following the progress of Berkay, Nerea, Matt,
  and Niels. After such a strong debut year, I’m very excited to see
  what the next generation of the BMW M Racing Academy will bring in 2026.”

“It was great
  that, in the second half of the year, we were able to dive deep into
  the DNA of BMW – the values, the core business, the history, and the
  future – to broaden the participants’ understanding as drivers and
  give them a bigger-picture view. At the start of the program, we
  worked with Formula Medicine to assess each participant’s physical and
  mental baseline, and from there we built personalized training plans.
  Seeing their progress over the year was very rewarding. The 24-hour
  simulation was also crucial for teaching how to approach such an
  event, manage rest periods, and recover both mentally and physically.
  For drivers without prior endurance experience, that’s a real
  eye-opener. Overall, my impression is extremely positive. It was a lot
  of fun, and we were able to give the participants behind-the-scenes
  insights that money can’t buy. I’m happy that we could always be there
  for them – whether analyzing onboard footage, answering questions, or
  sharing advice. I wish all four of them the very best and hope they
  can apply everything they’ve learned in the BMW M Racing Academy to
  their future careers, both on and off the track.”

“Racing for a brand like BMW is already something very special to me,
  but being part of the BMW family through the Academy made it even more
  meaningful. Having such close contact with all members of this big
  organization was incredibly valuable. The relationship with the three
  mentors was essential – especially since I’ve known Max for a long
  time and could exchange ideas with him throughout the year. I also
  spent a lot of time with Jens during the BMW M2 Racing tests, and his
  influence on my performance has been huge. After every test, we wrote
  reports to share with him, and after every race, I did race reports
  with my engineer – something I had never done before. It really helps
  us improve and analyze our weaknesses. I’ve also adapted my nutrition
  and training routines based on what I learned at Formula Medicine and
  use mental techniques during races to enhance my focus. All these
  experiences will be crucial for my future racing career.”

“The
  BMW M Racing Academy provided me with a complete preparation both on
  and off the track. I’m very grateful for the close connection to BMW
  and the opportunity to learn from everyone involved. I’ve learned to
  pay attention to small details and to plan my development
  strategically – from physical and mental preparation to communication
  and social media presence. The program has taught me how to prepare
  properly off the track, apply the right training methods, and balance
  physical and mental aspects to deliver my best performance. The chance
  to interact with our mentors and everyone involved in the program was
  incredibly valuable. Their experience, advice, and feedback had a big
  impact on my growth as a driver, and I’m confident that their guidance
  will continue to help me in the future.”

“My
  key takeaways fall into three categories: professionalism,
  performance, and in-depth knowledge of BMW M and BMW M Motorsport. The
  mentors in particular gave me a clear understanding of how to act as a
  BMW M driver and brand ambassador, both on and off the track. The
  conversations with Robby Foley and Max Hesse helped me build a
  framework for planning my next career steps. Overall, the program
  elevated me in every aspect as a driver and ambassador – from physical
  and mental training to recovery and team feedback. I’ve also started
  using media and interview opportunities much more effectively to
  represent myself and the brand. Sharing my story from the BMW M Racing
  Academy and my journey feels special. Representing the brand I raced
  with for years in club racing is personally a magical story for me.”

“The
  BMW M Racing Academy has given me insights into professional
  motorsport that you wouldn’t normally get. During the BMW M2 Racing
  tests, I gained my first experience in race car development, and
  working directly with the engineers was unique and highly educational.
  With the help of our mentors, especially Jens, I’ve learned how to
  give precise feedback to my race engineer. Thanks to our Formula
  Medicine training, I now prepare for races in a completely different
  way and can perform much better. All these important experiences have
  helped me develop further as a driver. Overall, the BMW M Racing
  Academy has made me a more complete racer.”
