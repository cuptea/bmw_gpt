The penultimate race of the season in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup at the Hockenheimring (GER) was the home event for ROWE Racing. The team from St. Ingbert (GER), around 150 kilometres from Hockenheim, showed fighting spirit after a disappointing qualifying session, putting the two BMW M4 GT3s into ninth and eleventh positions after great recovery performances in the three-hour race.

The BMW Junior Team with Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil
  Verhagen (USA) started the race from 22nd place in the #50 BMW M4 GT3
  and worked their way gradually up to ninth position. In the #98 car,
  Nick Catsburg (NED), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR)
  improved by a total of 17 positions, moving up from 28th to eleventh
  place. In the virtual race in the Fanatec Esports GT Pro Series on
  Saturday evening, Harper represented the ROWE Racing team as he
  claimed sixth place. The season finale in the Endurance Cup takes
  place on 2nd October at Barcelona (ESP).

“After the way this weekend went, we have to be satisfied with a top
  ten finish, even though we had hoped for a different result in our
  home race. We recognised early on that our cars would not deliver the
  performance here that we were looking for. At least our engineers and
  drivers were able to work together to close those gaps somewhat for
  the race. However, starting from so far back meant that this one top
  ten spot was the best we could do, even with a performance as
  faultless as that at Spa-Francorchamps. Unfortunately, we are still
  quite a way off the top.”

“It was a difficult weekend for us, but we made the best of it in the
  end and finished ninth to score two points. We had problems from the
  word go this weekend and we struggled to find a good balance. We still
  have a bit of work to before the next race in Barcelona. The ROWE
  Racing team did a super job here at Hockenheim, the pit stops were
  perfect and no-one on the team gave up. Thanks to everyone for that.“

“It was a very difficult weekend for us. We kind of
  expected that this track would not really suit our car and
  unfortunately in qualifying that showed. In the race we managed to
  climb 17 places and got a relatively good result. That is always one
  of the strengths of ROWE Racing to have clean races, to be smart with
  the pit stops and to make no mistakes, but unfortunately we clearly
  did not have the speed.“
