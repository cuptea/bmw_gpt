Philipp Eng (AUT), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Kevin Magnussen (DEN)
  were on course for fourth place after a consistently strong race, but
  around ten minutes before the finish, Eng reported a right-rear tyre
  puncture. The subsequent pit stop dropped the crew back to ninth
  place. In the #25 car, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco Wittmann
  (GER), and Robin Frijns (NED) finished eleventh. The trio lost touch
  with the leaders due to two drive-through penalties. The Petit Le Mans
  marked the final race for BMW M Team RLL with the BMW M Hybrid V8.
  After 17 years, 25 victories, and more than 100 podium finishes, the
  collaboration with BMW M Motorsport comes to an end. Starting in 2026,
  BMW M Team WRT will take over the racing operations in the GTP class.

In the GTD PRO class, the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO crew from Paul Miller
  Racing delivered a dominant weekend. Harper secured pole position in
  qualifying for the second consecutive time. During the race, the car
  led for nearly the entire ten hours and crossed the finish line as a
  well-deserved winner with a comfortable margin. The victory secured
  the Endurance Cup title for Harper and Hesse in their debut IMSA
  season. The #1 sister car fell far behind early in the race due to a
  technical issue and finished in ninth place. Turner Motorsport,
  competing in the GTD class, achieved eighth place with Robby Foley,
  Patrick Gallagher, and Jake Walker (all USA).

"Congratulations to Paul Miller Racing, Dan Harper, Max
  Hesse, and Connor De Phillippi on their fantastic victory, which also
  secured the Endurance Cup title for Dan and Max. It was truly a
  perfect race. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as we had hoped in the
  GTP class. For nine hours and 50 minutes, we were on course for second
  place in the drivers' standings, which would have been a great result.
  Then, the #24 car suffered the misfortune of a puncture. The #25 car
  was set back by two drive-through penalties. Unfortunately, the
  results don’t reflect our performance. The BMW M Hybrid V8 was strong
  in the race and had the potential for much better results. This was
  the final race for BMW M Team RLL with us in the GTP class. I want to
  sincerely thank the team for their dedication and loyalty over so many
  years and wish them all the best for the future. A big thank you also
  to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to our customer teams, Paul Miller
  Racing and Turner Motorsport, for a great season."

"It’s unbelievable that we suffered a puncture just ten
  minutes before the finish. We were in a good position, had a strong
  package, and were on course for fourth place in the race. That would
  have meant second place in the drivers' standings for Dries and me.
  It’s really disappointing, but life goes on. A big thank you to Dries
  for being such an incredible teammate this season. I especially want
  to thank BMW M Team RLL for eight great years together. Our first race
  at Daytona in 2018 was my debut in a works programme. Since then,
  we’ve experienced so much, and I’ve made many friends in the team.
  That makes this farewell emotional for me. Thanks also to BMW M
  Motorsport for all the hard work throughout the season."

"A tough end to a tough season – that
  probably sums up our year best. We often had the potential but didn’t
  manage to put everything together. We’ll take many lessons from this
  season. We didn’t get everything right, so maybe we didn’t deserve to
  be at the very top. But 2026 is a new year, and hopefully, we’ll come
  back stronger."

"What a fantastic weekend! It started great
  with pole position – my second in a row. The race was a first for Max
  and me, and it was great to have Connor with his Petit Le Mans
  experience on board. All three of us did a flawless job. The car
  doesn’t have a scratch, which is incredibly important in a
  long-distance race on such a narrow track with much faster prototypes.
  The race was a lot of fun, and ending the season with this victory and
  the Endurance Cup title is amazing. Unfortunately, we had some issues
  in other races this season, which cost us the chance to win the
  overall championship."

"I’m pretty speechless and exhausted after
  this tough race. Everyone said beforehand that Petit Le Mans is one of
  the hardest races to win. The fact that we managed to do it on our
  first attempt is incredible. Winning the Endurance Cup title on top of
  that crowns this day. Huge thanks to Paul Miller Racing for the
  perfect job and to BMW M Motorsport for the great car."

"For me, it was something new and
  special to race across two cars. Unfortunately, we had technical
  issues with the #1 car relatively early, so my focus shifted to the
  #48. The car felt fantastic and was very fast throughout the race. The
  team also did a flawless job. That’s how you win endurance races."
