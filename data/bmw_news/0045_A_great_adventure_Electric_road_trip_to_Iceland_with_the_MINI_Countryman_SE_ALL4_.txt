Summary:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All-electric from Munich to Iceland: a road trip from Bavaria to the Westfjords demonstrates that the fully electric MINI Countryman SE ALL4 is ready for adventure. In the heart of wild nature, the largest model in the MINI family shows just how versatile it is - and why it rightly carries its name.

For nature lovers, Iceland, is a true
  dream destination - and the easiest way to explore it is by car. Even
  though much has changed in the land of geysers, volcanoes, glaciers
  and endless mountain ranges, Iceland is always good for an adventure
  or two - and so is the MINI Countryman SE ALL4.

There are just
  under 2,700 kilometres as the crow flies between Munich and Reykjavik
  in the south of Iceland - and a few more to the Westfjords. By road,
  it is around 2,300 kilometres plus a two-day ferry crossing from
  Hirtshals in Denmark to Sedisfjödur.

Apart from the road network in the capital Reykjavik, there is
  hardly much more tarmac than the Ring Road, which is the easiest way
  to explore the island. The MINI Countryman SE ALL4 is therefore more
  rugged than the family SUV is normally known for when it leaves
  Munich: off-road tyres, luggage rack with spare wheel on the roof,
  sand plates, spade and jack are all part of the sensible equipment
  package if you want to experience sights such as waterfalls, geysers
  and fjords.

With its electric range of up to 432 kilometres according to the
  WLTP test cycle, the powerful MINI Countryman sets off on the first
  leg of its journey, which takes it via Hamburg to Denmark to the port
  of Hirtshals. The off-road tyres specially suited to the challenges of
  the island and the extensive roof structure hardly reduce the range of
  the MINI Countryman SE ALL4. With a maximum charging capacity of 130
  kW, less than 30 minutes remain for route preparation during
  stopovers. On the way along German motorways, the MINI Countryman SE
  ALL4 initially demonstrates its touring qualities: Two electric motors
  with a total output of 230 kW/313 hp and a torque of 494 Nm provide a
  powerful drive. The Driving Assistant Professional enables
  semi-automated driving for relaxed journeys and arrivals. Additional
  space in the redesigned interior gives the driver and front passenger
  more room in the shoulder and elbow area.

During the ferry crossing from Hirtshals in Denmark to
  Sedisfjödur in Iceland, the North Sea is unusually rough with a
  considerable storm and waves of over eight metres. The weather on
  arrival in Iceland is worse than expected: light snowfall, low clouds
  and temperatures below freezing. However, after the start of the stage
  on the way inland, the already impressive landscapes of lava rock
  become increasingly worth seeing. The never-ending midsummer sun wins
  the battle against the night - and so the Countryman reaches the hotel
  shortly after midnight in bright sunshine after a long first stage on
  Iceland's mainland.

Early the next morning, at around five o'clock, the MINI
  Countryman SE ALL4, which has long since been heavily soiled, sets off
  on the challenging final stage of Route 622 - one of the most
  demanding and dangerous tracks in the Westfjords with a particularly
  spectacular scree passage by the water, which can only be driven
  through at low tide.

With its ‘Blazing Blue’ paintwork,
  bronze-coloured elements thanks to the Favoured Trim, all terrain
  tyres and roof rack, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 causes quite a stir
  and is a real talking point on the road. Dust and mud on the rough
  routes cannot diminish its radiance along the journey.

The all-electric MINI Countryman masters green meadows, gloomy
  scree or narrow paths with cliff overhangs and water crossings with
  ease. A gentle off-road pace hardly reduces the electric range. Here
  and there it touches down, scraping the turf, while the views of the
  sea and the steeply sloping coastline become increasingly spectacular.
  The MINI Countryman is tenacious, confident and fully electric as it
  battles its way along the narrow and challenging Route 622, the
  conditions of which have been made even more difficult by the rainfall
  of recent weeks.

Coming from the south, nothing works just before the beach
  section of Route 622: where waves and weather have torn everything
  away, the notorious track is no longer passable by any vehicle. Even
  spades, sand trays and jacks can't help. And yet, between Munich and
  Iceland, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 proves that it rightly bears its
  name - even fully electrically.
