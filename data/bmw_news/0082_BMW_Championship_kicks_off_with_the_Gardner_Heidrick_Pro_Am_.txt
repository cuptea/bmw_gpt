  BMW Championship, with the top 70 players on the PGA TOUR, begins
  today +++

The BMW Championship, the penultimate Playoff
  event in the FedExCup on the PGA TOUR, opened on Wednesday with the
  traditional Gardner Heidrick Pro-Am. 65 pros teamed up with amateurs
  and took to the course at Wilmington Country Club, which is hosting
  the prestigious tournament for the first time. Among those teeing off
  were former professional basketballer and two-time NBA champion
  (Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Lakers) J.R. Smith, former NFL
  footballer and Super Bowl winner (New York Giants) Victor Cruz, and
  BMW Motorsport works driver Connor De Phillippi.

The Gardner Heidrick Pro-Am is the Western Golf Association’s biggest
  fundraising event for its charity the Evans Scholar Foundation (ESF).
  Current and former scholars accompany the pros as caddies for the day.
  All revenues from the Pro-Am, and all other proceeds from the BMW
  Championship, will support the foundation. The ESF provides full
  tuition and housing scholarships for hardworking young caddies. Since
  the tournament’s inception 16 years ago, The BMW Championship has
  raised over $40 million for the Evans Scholars Foundation and helped
  send 3,300 caddies to college. For the upcoming school year, a record
  1,100 Evans Scholars will attend 22 leading universities nationwide.

The opening round of the BMW Championship begins today at 09:10 local
  time. Harold Varner III (USA) and Alex Noren (SWE) will tee off in the
  first group. The top pairing of FedExCup leader Will Zalatoris and
  world number one Scottie Scheffler (both USA), starts at 12:40. There
  is no cut at the BMW Championship, but that does not make the
  competition any less intense. Only the top 30 in the FedExCup ranking
  after the tournament will qualify to play at next week’s TOUR Championship.
