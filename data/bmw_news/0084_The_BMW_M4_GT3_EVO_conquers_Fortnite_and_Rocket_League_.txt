The virtual BMW M4 GT3 EVO will also be making a splash with a

  of the main character of “BLEACH”, Ichigo Kurosaki. BMW Welt visitors

“By integrating the BMW M4 GT3 EVO into Rocket League and Fortnite we
  are showcasing the fascination of the spearhead of our BMW M
  Motorsport product line in GT racing to a young audience,” said Timo
  Brückner, Project Lead BMW M Automotive Gaming. “These games are
  social and creative meeting points where the young generation comes
  together. The multifaceted collaboration between BMW M, Epic Games,
  ‘BLEACH’, and PUMA facilitates uniting motorsport and digital pop
  culture. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO design is spectacular, and we are
  confident that every player – as well as fans of the ‘BLEACH’ series
  and visitors to BMW Welt – will be impressed by this car.”
