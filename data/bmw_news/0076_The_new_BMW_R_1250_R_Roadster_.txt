Whether on winding country roads, over soaring alpine passes, on a
  tour with a pillion or on a short, relaxing ride after work - the R
  1250 R shines thanks to its sporty agility, comfort and the primal
  dynamic performance of the boxer engine. Now BMW Motorrad has given
  the R 1250 R some new standard features and optional extras - to
  generate even more intensive roadster enjoyment.

As before, the legendary 2-cylinder boxer engine provides
  powerful propulsion. It still has an engine capacity of 1,254
  cm

and, even in the current EU5 registration, generates
  100 kW (136 hp). Thanks to BMW ShiftCam technology for varying valve
  timing and valve lift on the intake side, it delivers beefy power
  across the entire speed range, extremely smooth and quiet running and
  outstanding fuel consumption and emission values.

Here, the standard Dynamic Traction Control DTC ensures a high level
  of riding safety thanks to providing excellent traction. The new
  standard "ECO" riding mode helps the rider to travel as
  fuel-efficiently as possible.

The ECO riding mode allows the rider to use the innovative BMW
  Motorrad ShiftCam engine technology primarily in such a way to achieve
  the maximum range. In ECO mode, the rider is encouraged to ride as
  fuel-efficiently as possible with a soft throttle curve and moderate
  engine torque limitation. In ECO mode, the TFT colour display provides
  an efficiency display in the upper status line. If you want maximum
  performance - for example for overtaking with a heavy load or riding
  uphill - the ride mode button can be used to quickly and easily switch
  to a different ride mode.

The new R 1250 R can be equipped with the Pro riding modes
  option as optional equipment ex works. Among other things, it provides
  additional, individually configurable riding modes. By using the
  riding mode preselection function, the rider can individually set
  riding modes on the riding mode button. The engine drag torque control
  (MSR) is another new component of the Pro riding mode. It can be used
  to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during
  coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel.

As a popular sports tourer, the R 1250 R in its latest edition
  features BMW Integral ABS Pro as standard. This is a braking system,
  which offers even more safety when braking - even when leaning into
  bends - and thinks even further ahead, so to speak. As the riding mode
  concept continues to expand, more new functions will also be added.
  For example, the ABS control characteristic will be adapted further to
  the respective riding mode. As part of the "Riding Modes
  Pro" option, Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) additionally supports
  the rider during emergency braking manoeuvres. DBC increases safety
  when braking, even in difficult situations, by avoiding unintentional
  throttle activation. By means of intervention in the engine control,
  drive torque is reduced during braking so as to make full use of the
  braking power at the rear wheel. This keeps the motorcycle stable and
  shortens the braking distance.

The standard full LED headlamp already illuminates the road with an
  unrivalled bright, clear light. Enhanced safety when riding at night
  is ensured by the adaptive turning light which is a component of as an
  ex works option. The rider benefits from even better illumination of
  the road on bends, thereby ensuring even safer riding at night. The
  adaptive turning light works by switching on additional LED elements
  in the main headlight that are fitted with their own reflectors,
  depending on the leaning angle. It is activated from an inclined
  position of more than 7° and a speed of more than 10 km/h. The
  additional lighting effect can be perfectly experienced up to a
  leaning angle of 25°.

New standard features include redesigned LED tun indicators
  (also for the USA) and the iconic daytime running light (not permitted
  in all countries; without daytime running light function, the light
  icon is designed as a parking light).

As before, the new R 1250 R is equipped with a TFT colour display
  featuring integrated arrow navigation and extensive connectivity.
  Excellent readability, clear menu navigation and a highly integrated
  operating concept place it at the top of the production motorbike
  world. The rider can choose between customised screen displays for
  various purposes. This also includes the "Sport” Core Screen,
  which provides real-time information about the current and maximum
  lean angle as well as control interventions - such as ABS Pro or DTC.

The new BMW R 1250 R already offers two different sockets as
  standard. The previous 12-volt on-board power socket plus an
  additional USB-A socket with a 5-volt power supply. This most widely
  used type of USB socket with newly developed charging electronics
  allows you to charge a smartphone while riding by connecting a cable
  adapter. Up to 2,400 mA charging current is available, enabling fast
  charging depending on the type of smartphone used. The Intelligent
  Emergency Call is also a standard feature (eCall; not available in all
  countries) for providing rapid assistance in emergencies.

A seat heating system for rider and pillion passenger as an
  optional extra ex works also significantly increases comfort when
  temperatures are low. Heated seats are available in combination with
  two individual seats and are offered exclusively in combination with
  heated grips. A new, convenient operating concept has been developed
  for the rider's seat with five heating levels. The heated grips
  settings - in combination with the seat heating featuring five instead
  of two heating levels - are operated via a menu. The pillion seat
  heating has two heating levels and is operated by a toggle switch at
  the bottom left of the rear frame.

In the basic variant, the new BMW R 1250 R highlights its advanced
  roadster style in Icegrey non-metallic in conjunction with a black
  frame. With the Triple Black and Style Sport variants, available
  optionally ex works, the customer can choose from two particularly
  expressive colour concepts.

- Body colour Racingblue metallic, white frame, gold front/rear brake
  callipers, black sports handlebars black, blue front spoiler blue,
  solo rear (alternatively pillion package).

Blackstorm metallic body colour, agate grey frame, gold front/rear
  brake callipers, stainless steel radiator grille, stainless steel
  engine spoiler, Pure tank trim, solo rear (alternatively pillion package).

The new solo rear optional feature underlines the sporty style
  of the new R 1250 R and makes it look particularly light and dynamic.
  The pillion seat is replaced with a painted plastic cover and the
  pillion footrests and pillion handles are removed.

If you want to keep the R 1250 R fully suitable for pillion use,
  the pillion package is available as an alternative package within the
  model variants. It contains all the components that are eliminated by
  the solo rear.
