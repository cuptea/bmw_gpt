The BMW Group has defined a
  new 2035 milestone for cutting CO

e emissions on the road
  to net zero. The company aims to reduce its CO

e emissions
  by at least 60 million metric tons compared to 2019 levels, an
  additional reduction of approximately 20 million tons of
  CO

e beyond the existing 2030 target.

In doing so, the BMW Group is pursuing a comprehensive
  decarbonization strategy along the entire life cycle, with the goal of
  achieving net zero by 2050 at the latest. This represents a firm
  commitment to the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. To date, the
  target has been to cut at least 40 million metric tons of
  CO

e across the entire life cycle (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by
  2030 compared to 2019 levels. The new 2035 milestone is a logical next
  step on this road toward advancing decarbonization. At the same time,
  the climate impact of the BMW Group’s business model will also be
  drastically reduced. By 2035, each euro generated will see less than
  half as much CO

e emitted compared to 2019.

The key measures for achieving these results include the increasing
  use of renewable energies in production and the supply chain, the
  increased utilization of secondary raw materials, efficiency
  improvements in the use phase, as well as product and process
  innovations. The latter are being implemented across all drive
  variants as part of the BMW Group’s technology-neutral approach. In
  addition, an increasing proportion of the vehicle fleet will continue
  to be electrified.

The BMW Group has intentionally set itself the additional 2035
  milestone to consistently advance its decarbonization strategy. Global
  customer demand for electric vehicles alone will not be sufficient to
  achieve the CO

e targets set for 2030 and 2035. The
  comprehensive approach to reducing CO

e emissions therefore
  spans the entire vehicle life cycle, irrespective of the drive variant.

In the supply chain, which is increasingly relevant in terms of
  CO

e emissions, especially for electric models, the company
  focuses on expanding the use of secondary raw materials and renewable
  energies. The specific priorities are highly CO

e-emitting
  components such as high-voltage batteries, aluminum, and steel. In
  addition, the company will be implementing product and process
  innovations, such as in the BMW Group’s sixth generation (Gen6) of
  battery technology.

The BMW Group also applies high standards in production: for example,
  since 2020, all electricity sourced from external suppliers for all
  plants worldwide has come exclusively from renewable sources. The BMW
  Group also works continuously on replacing fossil fuels. The new plant
  in Debrecen, Hungary, is the BMW Group’s first car factory to produce
  vehicles without any fossil fuels such as oil and gas in standard operation.

To lower CO

e emissions during the use phase, the BMW
  Group is implementing additional efficiency measures such as BMW
  EfficientDynamics, in addition to electrifying its vehicle fleet. As a
  result, efficiency potential in all vehicle subsystems, such as the
  drive system, tires, and aerodynamics, is consistently identified and
  implemented, regardless of the drive technology. The new BMW iX3, for
  instance, uses up to 20% less energy (WLTP combined) than its predecessor.

Reaching the new milestone will also depend on a variety of external
  factors, such as the transformation of the steel industry in favor of
  more CO

e-reduced steel, the expansion of the charging
  infrastructure, progress in the circular economy, and the advancement
  of battery cell technologies. This is why the BMW Group continues to
  pursue a number of strategic initiatives, such as the ongoing
  expansion of in-house expertise in state-of-the-art battery cell
  centers of excellence and innovative circular economy projects.
