The aerodynamic updates to the BMW M Hybrid V8 for the 2026 season
  were already showcased during previous test drives, including the
  smaller kidney grille and the modified front splitter designed to
  optimise airflow and cooling. Now, Daytona will see the addition of
  another significant update: the new headlights. The advanced
  technology of the track lights ensures improved visibility for drivers
  during the numerous night races in the IMSA series and the FIA World
  Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). These include the 24-hour highlights
  at Daytona and Le Mans (FRA), as well as the 12 Hours of Sebring
  (USA), Petit Le Mans in North America, and the FIA WEC events in Qatar
  and Bahrain. The track lights illuminate the car's surroundings even
  more brightly, helping drivers better assess race situations,
  especially in poorly lit sections of the track.

In addition to technological advancements, the new headlights also
  offer an iconic design element. The yellow accents of the yellow
  lights pay homage to the current generation of BMW M Motorsport race
  cars, as the EVO models of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 share the
  same design features. Furthermore, they are a nod to the
  high-performance vehicles of BMW M GmbH. For example, the current CS
  models of the BMW M3, BMW M4, and BMW M5 feature yellow headlights, as
  do BMW M models from previous generations. Alongside the headlights,
  the kidney grille of the BMW M Hybrid V8 will also stand out at night
  thanks to its unique contour lighting, BMW Iconic Glow.

On Friday and Saturday, BMW M Team WRT will have five test sessions
  to gain initial experience with the hypercar on the Daytona
  International Speedway and familiarise themselves with the procedures
  of the IMSA series. The Belgian team, which already knows the car well
  from two seasons in the FIA WEC, will be supported at Daytona by BMW M
  Team RLL. This collaboration aims to ease and accelerate BMW M Team
  WRT's adaptation to the IMSA series. Behind the wheel of cars number
  24 and 25, BMW M works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED),
  Kevin Magnussen (DEN), René Rast (GER), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and
  Marco Wittmann (GER) will alternate during the two test days.

“I am very
  excited that we can present and test the update of our BMW M Hybrid V8
  at Daytona for the first time in the IMSA environment. The new design
  and headlights not only look spectacular but are also intended to
  further optimise performance. We will work hard on this during the
  test at Daytona, as well as in January during the Roar. The time we
  have before the 24-hour race at the end of January will be used as
  effectively as possible to prepare both the cars with their updates
  and BMW M Team WRT for the first season highlight.”
