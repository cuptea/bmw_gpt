In front of the picturesque
  background of Villa d'Este at Lake Como, BMW Motorrad unveils its
  latest design masterpiece: the BMW R20 concept. This motorcycle
  celebrates the highest craftsmanship and presents itself as the
  epitome of expressive and cool design, refined down to the last detail.

As part of the renowned Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, famous for
  its elegance and historical significance for extraordinary vehicles,
  BMW Motorrad showcases the legendary air-oil cooled Big Boxer engine
  as a central sculptural element.

Markus Flasch, Head of BMW Motorrad, describes the concept as
  follows:

"The BMW R20 concept is a mechanical masterpiece,
  with the Big Boxer in its center. Distinctly BMW Motorrad."

The BMW R20 concept is a motorcycle that impresses with a powerful
  appearance in a casual gentleman style, while fulfilling typical
  attributes of BMW Motorrad: classic design and excellent engineering
  combined with thrilling mechanics.

Centered around the Big Boxer engine as the epicenter of great riding
  pleasure, the expressive tank presents itself like a sculpture, the
  rear is reduced to the essentials to emphasize the clean lines and the
  power of the motorcycle.

The chassis has been completely redeveloped and, with a black
  double-loop main frame made of chrome-molybdenum steel tubes, forms
  the backbone. With the black disc wheel at 17x6.25 inches at the rear,
  on which a tire of the dimension 200/55 is mounted, and a 17"
  spoke wheel with black spokes and the tire dimension 120/70 at the
  front, the

BMW R20 concept combines tradition and modernity. The
  proven BMW Paralever has been executed in a new two-arm variant, in
  which the swingarm is made of chrome-molybdenum steel and the
  Paralever strut is made of aluminum. The kinematics are designed so
  that the drive torque is completely balanced. The two milled aluminum
  rear axle carriers are another high-quality detail. The exposed
  driveshaft, conceptually adopted from the R18 – the visual highlight
  of the well-known R 18 models - has been shortened for integration
  into the roadster architecture. As suspension elements, fully
  adjustable Öhlins Blackline components work at the front and rear. The
  basic vehicle geometry has a steering head angle of 62.5°, as well as
  a wheelbase of 1,550 mm. Radially mounted brake calipers from ISR at
  the front and rear take care of the deceleration – with six pistons at
  the front and four pistons per brake caliper at the
  rear.

Additionally, the 2-in-2 exhaust system delivers the
  appropriate sound character and perfectly completes the design.

As a Big Boxer Roadster, the BMW R20 concept sets new standards in
  the world of motorcycles and confirms BMW Motorrad's commitment to the
  finest engineering and the pure passion for motorcycling.

The centerpiece of the BMW R20 concept continues to be the
  air-oil-cooled Big Boxer engine, now with a displacement of 2,000 cc.
  For the concept bike, new cylinder head covers, a new belt cover and a
  new oil cooler were developed, in order to be able to mount the oil
  pipes partially hidden.

A special highlight is the side view: The eye follows the path of the
  air as it flows through the open intake funnels into the throttle
  bodies and cylinders, before escaping through the open exhaust system
  and the tailpipes in megaphone design, creating the typical

Big
  Boxer sound.

The aluminum tank got a new design and presents itself in the
  progressive color

"hotter than pink" from the 1970´s.
  The BMW R20 concept is color-coordinated with the cylinder head
  covers, belt cover and air intake funnels made of polished and
  anodized aluminum, as well as the Paralever strut, footrest system and
  the ISR brake calipers in gunmetal.

The taillight has been perfectly integrated into the single seat,
  which is upholstered with quilted black Alcantara and fine-grain
  leather, and emphasizes the dynamic roadster appearance with its
  compact rear. The modern LED headlight is presented in form of a
  3D-printed aluminum ring with integrated daytime running light. The
  main headlight appears to float optically in the middle of this
  daytime running light ring.

Each of these details contributes to the unique character of the
  concept bike and underscores its overall statement:

The BMW R20
  concept takes the Big Boxer Culture to a new level.

“The R20 concept is a bold interpretation of the BMW Motorrad DNA,”
  says Alexander Buckan, Head of Design BMW Motorrad.

“It combines
  modern technical elements with a classic roadster design. Its
  oversized proportions and minimalistic aesthetic make it an
  unmistakable character.”
