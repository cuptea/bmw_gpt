Summary:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a ten-year break, a MINI John Cooper Works will once again compete in the legendary 24-hour race at the Nürburgring in 2022. The race car entered by the private team Bulldog Racing and built up in Nürburg will compete in the SP3T class.

The 24-hour race at the Nürburgring
  is considered to be the ultimate endurance test for man and machine.
  The 50th edition of the high-speed showdown will take place this year
  from 26 to 29 May on the 25.378 kilometre circuit consisting of the
  Grand Prix circuit and the legendary Nordschleife of the Nürburgring
  with a MINI John Cooper Works competing.

In September last year, the project was launched at Bulldog Racing in
  the Eifel region, just a few metres away from the Nordschleife. The
  base vehicle is a MINI John Cooper Works with the 4-cylinder turbo
  engine known from the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman and MINI John
  Cooper Works Countryman with 225 kW/306 hp and a maximum torque of 450
  Nm. The 8-speed Steptronic gearbox taken from large-series-production
  featuring an integrated, mechanical differential lock with a locking
  effect of up to 70% ensures that the drive torque is converted into
  thrilling performance without any losses.

For racing purposes, the following modifications were made to the
  standard MINI John Cooper Works which go beyond SP3T class regulations:

Pat Moss made motorsport history in 1962, scoring the first
  international rally victory for MINI at the Tulip Rally. Her victory
  marked the beginning of the Classic Mini's unique success story in
  rally sport, with 3 overall Monte Carlo Rally wins in 1964 (Paddy
  Hopkirk), 1965 (Timo Mäkinen) and 1967 (Rauno Aaltonen).

This string of successes included six overall Dakar Rally victories
  in 2012 (Leonid Novitskiy), 2013 (Stéphane Peterhansel), 2014 (Nani
  Roma), 2015 (Nasser Al-Attiyah), 2020 (Carlos Sainz Sr.) and 2021
  (Stéphane Peterhansel).

The MINI John Cooper Works racing car "Made in Nürburg"
  pays homage to the racing tradition of the MINI brand in the classic
  colour scheme of the 1960s racing cars in red / white.

Only seven months passed between the start of the project and the
  roll-out at the end of March 2022. In the coming weeks and until the
  start of the 24h race, further tests are scheduled on the Nordschleife
  of the Nürburgring and at the BMW Group testing centre in Miramas in
  southern France. Located between Marseille and Avignon, the former
  race track offers the best conditions for extensive testing and
  optimisation under a wide range of conditions. The chassis of the MINI
  John Cooper Works racing car is subjected to an extensive and varied
  test programme there. Friedhelm Thelen, Nürburgring expert and team
  boss of Bulldog Racing, knows how important comprehensive testing is
  before a race: "The 24-hour race at the Nürburgring puts all
  components of the vehicle under extreme stress. That's why we're
  delighted to be able to use the BMW Group Test Centre to put the John
  Cooper Works through its paces there."

The BMW Group has been testing new models and innovative chassis
  technology at the Miramas test grounds since 1986.

The driver line-up and the further race programme for 2022 will be
  announced at a later date.
