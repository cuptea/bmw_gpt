The iconic BMW Baby Racer has been a popular
  element of the BMW Lifestyle Collection for more than 30 years. Now in
  its fourth generation, it is presented in a new design with a
  distinctive character, to pass on FREUDE to the brand’s youngest fans.
  Based on the design of current BMW models, the new BMW Baby Racer is
  far more than just a miniature version, and knows how to impress with
  its custom features and proportions.

The sporty new
  version of the BMW Baby Racer offers even our youngest enthusiasts
  maximum comfort with its new, comfortable soft seat in contrasting
  colours, ergonomic three-spoke steering wheel, and whisper wheels
  (tyres) made from recycled materials. The horn integrated into the
  redesigned cockpit ensures safety and a clear path ahead for kids aged
  one to three, whether at home or outdoors. The front features the BMW
  kidney grille in the brand’s latest design, fully following the style
  of the full-size BMW 4 Series, BMW iX and BMW M3/M4 role models. And
  anyone being passed by the new BMW Baby Racer will see its sporty tail lights.

The BMW Baby Racer is available in the colours black, blue and white
  with seats in contrasting colours for a striking and dynamic look and
  FREUDE on four wheels. To make sure the pleasure of driving really
  stays with young fans, all spare parts for the BMW Baby Racer produced
  in Bavaria are available from selected BMW dealers – that’s something
  this nippy little car and its big role models have in common. This
  means that nothing will stand in the way of a long friendship with the
  BMW brand and experiencing sheer driving pleasure from an early age.

The BMW Baby Racer will be available from April 2023 onwards,
  from selected dealers and online at
