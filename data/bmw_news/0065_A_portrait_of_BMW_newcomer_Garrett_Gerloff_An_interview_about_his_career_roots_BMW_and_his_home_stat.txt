In a video clip, he also takes us on a very personal trip through his
  home state of Texas. The clip can be seen here on Gerloff’s YouTube channel:

Garrett Gerloff: “It’s super exciting. Joining the BMW squad is
  definitely a new chapter in my life. And it’s been great so far. I’m
  really enjoying working with the team that I have and also with all
  the BMW engineers and everybody. It’s a really great atmosphere and
  I’m really enjoying myself.”

Gerloff: “Indeed. It’s fact that I already have a history with
  the BMW brand. The link is my dad. For most of his life, he has worked
  as a car salesman and mainly at BMW dealerships, so BMW cars were
  around me early on. My dad always brought some different models home
  and took us to drive around, for example stick shift cars like the BMW
  Z4. He let me change gears for him when he pushed the clutch. I have
  such good memories from that and all the different BMW cars with my
  parents. It has been great adventures, so I definitely have a soft
  spot in my heart for BMW since my childhood. We used to go to the dirt
  tracks in his BMW X3. It’s funny as I think this car is from 2005 and
  I’m actually still driving it around at home, when taking the dirt
  bikes. And now, being back in Texas recently, we got this amazing BMW
  X4 M Competition*. It was so much fun driving it around to discover
  Texas. A BMW product is always a fun thing to experience, whether it
  got two or four wheels.”

Gerloff: “Yes, it is a really nice link. My last name, Gerloff,
  apparently has a lot of German heritage, from what I understand. There
  is actually so much German heritage here in Texas. There’s a lot of
  immigrants from Germany that came across a long time ago, including my
  ancestors. My great grandpa has a plaque that was hanging in his house
  that had the Gerloff seal. My ancestors came and they founded Old
  Glory, Texas. So, it just feels like full circle. I am riding for BMW
  Motorrad now, a German brand. My family comes from Germany and has a
  lot of history there. And here in Texas, my dad basically has been
  selling BMWs for my whole life. I think it’s a round story.”

Gerloff: “My journey, my story is definitely kind of crazy.
  Coming from Texas and ending up racing in WorldSBK - it’s been quite a
  journey. I just try to put my head down. I knew what I wanted to do
  with my life. I knew where I wanted to go. I knew that I wanted to
  race in the world championship. And I tried to line up my life the
  best that I could to make it happen. And crazily enough, you know, it
  has so far.”

Gerloff: “My love for motorcycles started back when I was a kid
  watching my dad ride motocross during the weekends. My dad’s dad was
  also a motocross rider and my dad’s mum rode motocross bikes in the
  powderpuff class back when she was young, too. So basically I’ve got
  motorcycles in my blood. My love for motorcycles started on dirt but
  soon after that, we started going the road racing route and I was
  having a lot more fun on two wheels on asphalt, just the sensation of
  speed and everything. It just got me hooked.

As soon as I started road racing, I knew that it was what I wanted to
  do with my life. I really put everything into it. I was training every
  day. I was trying to prepare myself mentally. I was I was doing
  everything that I could to make sure I could be the best version of
  myself on the road race bike. I was watching the professionals and
  tried to apply myself as much as I could to see if I could make it a
  career one day. It was a crazy series of events that led me from being
  an amateur to racing professionally in MotoAmerica, to finally moving
  up to Superbike in MotoAmerica, and then going to WorldSBK. There’s so
  many details and things that lined up that I never would have
  imagined. But I look back and just smile, thinking about how it all
  connected in the end.

It definitely wasn’t a straight shot through. There’s been a lot of
  difficult times in my career. But I look back at every one and I know
  that every single time something negative happened, it made me a
  stronger person and I really had to learn how to persevere through
  those tough times. And man, it makes the positives, the high points,
  just so much sweeter.”

Gerloff: “I’m a Texan at heart, and being here at Circuit Of The
  Americas was just such a good feeling. It was so nice being back in my
  home state. Especially since I got to go and do a few laps at COTA
  with the brand new 2023 BMW M 1000 RR Moto GP Safety Bike. It’s been
  so nice being back home, seeing all my family and friends at the
  track. I’ve seen just so many people that I haven’t seen in many
  years. It’s been so long since I’ve come to America during a race
  weekend and it just brings back so many good memories, so many good
  vibes with everybody from my past that I’ve seen. And it’s just stuff
  like this that really makes me smile.”

Gerloff: “For me, Texas definitely is home. It’s all about the
  people in my life. It’s about my family and friends. I feel so blessed
  to be able to do what I do, to be able to travel around the world and
  to see so many new places and people. But really, there’s just nothing
  like coming back home, coming back to Texas. Seeing my close group of
  friends, family and being able to fully just relax and kind of block
  out the rest of the world.

Growing up in Texas, I had some friends that were doing the rodeo for
  riding horses. I found a different kind of rodeo that that suited me.
  Since then, I have been more on the iron horse side of things.

Some of my favourite things about Texas are the music, the vibe
  around here, the barbecue. There’s nothing like barbecuing with
  friends. At the end of the day, the sunsets here just seem to be on
  another level. I think it’s just that that flat land, wide open skies,
  it just paints such a such a nice picture. It’s also always nice to
  meet new people and explore a different side of Texas. There are so
  many interesting people in Texas. You have such a wide variety. Even
  in my home city of Houston. There are people from all over the world.
  It opens your eyes up to all these different cultures. It’s really
  just a melting pot of cultures.”

Gerloff: “That is something I haven’t thought about yet. But if
  I wasn’t racing, I would still be on two wheels no matter what. I love
  motorcycles. I love being on two wheels. It’s one of the things that
  makes me the happiest in life. But if I wasn’t a motorcycle racer
  there’s a few different things that I that I’d be interested in. I
  really like nutrition and like the physical side of what I do. I like
  the training and stuff, it’s something that really interests me. I
  really love photography and videography, ever since I was a kid. It’s
  something I’ve been curious about. So that would have been a cool path
  to go down. I’ve also been interested in construction. I think it’s so
  cool to be able to build something like a house and to be able to back
  up and look at it once that project is complete. Building custom bikes
  is something similar. We went to the Handbuilt Motorcycle Show in
  Austin and we got to see all these custom bikes that people have spent
  so much time and energy into making. They make these beautiful pieces
  of art and being able to step back, to see all your hard work and to
  see other people appreciating it, too, has to be such a fulfilling feeling.”

Gerloff: “Yes, I’ve been in Europe for almost four years now.
  And every time I come home to Texas, people say I get like more and
  more of an accent, but I don’t know what they’re talking about. I
  don’t hear it at all. But I think it’s so funny to see my friends and
  family after a while, and the first thing they call out is that I’m
  talking a different way now.

Besides that, I think there’s positives and negatives to both. I
  mean, there’s a lot of things from Europe that I wish the US had.
  There’s a lot of things that Texas has that I wish Europe and Andorra
  had. That stuff. But there are pros and cons to everything. I feel
  like a lucky guy to be able to experience both. And once I get sick of
  one, I go to the other. But it’s the complete opposite. It’s got
  mountains there in Andorra, flatlands and sun in Texas, that’s nice.
  But one of the things I really appreciate about Europe in general, and
  especially where I live in Andorra, is just how many people are on
  motorcycles, like how many people are on two wheels. I think that’s
  such a cool thing. You just feel so free being on two wheels and
  especially like up in the mountains there in Europe, just being able
  to ride through the twisty roads, to see other people on motorcycles
  and connect with them.

I think that’s the coolest thing about motorcycles, it just brings
  people together from all different cultures, all different
  backgrounds, all different countries, and we can all come together and
  have that one thing in common. That’s what you feel especially in
  Europe where all those countries are that close together.”

Gerloff: “In general, I think life is just too short. I really don’t
  feel like we have as much time on earth as we want to believe. And
  with this in mind, I like to say yes to the craziest things, just to
  go out to experience as much as I can. Whenever it’s my time to go
  beyond this world, I would like to have a story that’s worth telling,
  that people would be interested in hearing. So that really inspires me
  to take risks and take chances. And I really wouldn’t have gone to
  WorldSBK and changed up my entire life if didn’t believe that. I try
  to live my life to the fullest while I am here on this world.”
