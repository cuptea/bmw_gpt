The BMW Art Car World Tour is set to
  arrive in Milan at the ADI Design Museum, marking a major milestone in
  the celebration of five decades of artistic innovation. From 4
  December 2025 to 8 January 2026, visitors will have the opportunity to
  experience eight iconic BMW Art Cars designed by internationally
  renowned artists such as Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Roy
  Lichtenstein, and Jeff Koons. Having previously travelled to Art Basel
  Hong Kong, Le Mans Classic in France, the Bridge in USA, Louwman
  Museum in the Netherlands, Belgium’s Zoute Grand Prix and over 45
  further stops in more than 30 countries across the globe, the BMW Art
  Car World Tour will conclude this year in Milan before continuing on
  to Rétromobile in Paris in 2026.

“Celebrating 50 years of the BMW Art Cars is truly a
  privilege and a great emotion for us, as it allows us to express our
  commitment to the world of art and design, which finds the perfect
  setting in Italy. Having eight cars on display at the ADI Museum in
  Milan also means hosting the exhibition with the highest number of BMW
  Art Cars featured in the 2025 world anniversary tour — a strong sign
  of our commitment and our desire to convey the brand’s values to
  enthusiasts, customers, media and partners.”

The Italian leg of the Art Car World Tour kicked off at the Concorso
  d'Eleganza 2025, where the Sandro Chia Art Car was exhibited alongside
  the entire BMW Art Car miniature collection. On 29 and 30 November,
  the tour continues at the Nanni Nember “House of BMW Brescia”, where
  three legendary BMW Art Cars will be on display together with the new
  BMW iX3, the first model of the “Neue Klasse”. Located in the heart of
  Milan, a global capital of fashion and design, the ADI Design Museum
  will provide the perfect setting to showcase eight vehicles from the
  world-renowned collection to close the year:

The ADI Design Museum in Milan celebrates both Italian and
  international creativity and innovation. Since 2021, it has showcased
  award-winning works that have shaped the history of industrial design
  and aesthetics. Located in the heart of the city, the museum occupies
  a repurposed industrial space that harmoniously blends historical
  architecture with contemporary style, offering an ideal setting for
  exhibitions exploring the intersection of art, innovation, and culture.

Milan takes its place on the global stage as part of the
  ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a journey that will span
  continents and continue well into 2026. Marking the 50th anniversary
  of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of
  exhibitions across five continents, enhanced by a vibrant array of events.

The BMW Art Car initiative was born in 1975 when French racing driver
  and art dealer Hervé Poulain, in collaboration with BMW’s then Head of
  Motorsport, Jochen Neerpasch, invited artist Alexander Calder to
  transform a car into a work of art. The result was a strikingly
  reimagined BMW 3.0 CSL, which not only became a visual masterpiece but
  also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, earning widespread acclaim.
  Over the years, the collection has grown to include contributions from
  legendary artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol,
  Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer,
  Jeff Koons and Julie Mehretu, each bringing their unique vision and
  style to the project.

Following the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection and the
  BMW 3 Series this year, car enthusiasts can look forward to another
  jubilee next year: 2026 will mark the 50th anniversary of

, one of the world’s most prestigious
  automotive shows dedicated to the classic car sector. To celebrate
  this milestone, BMW is bringing together all BMW Art Cars that have
  raced at Le Mans for a spectacular reunion in Paris early next year.
