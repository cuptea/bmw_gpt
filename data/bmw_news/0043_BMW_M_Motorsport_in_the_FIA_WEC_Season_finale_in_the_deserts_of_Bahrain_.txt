In the LMGT3 class, which had recently seen two consecutive podium
  finishes for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars, the #31 car from The Bend Team
  WRT finished seventh in Bahrain. Behind the wheel were Augusto Farfus
  (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS). Valentino Rossi
  (ITA), Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) concluded
  their final FIA WEC race of the season in 15th position in the #46 BMW
  M4 GT3 EVO entered by Team WRT.

Among the highlights of the 2025 FIA WEC season for BMW M Motorsport
  was a podium finish in the Hypercar class for the #20 Shell BMW M
  Hybrid V8 at Imola (ITA). In the LMGT3 category, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO
  achieved a total of four podium finishes: the #46 took second place at
  both Imola and Austin (USA), while the #31 finished third in Doha
  (QAT) and Fuji (JPN).

The day after the season finale traditionally features the FIA WEC
  Rookie Test in Bahrain. For BMW M Team WRT, BMW M works drivers Kelvin
  van der Linde and Charles Weerts (BEL) – who this season have won
  titles in the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC) and GT World
  Challenge Europe, among other successes – will complete their first
  laps in the BMW M Hybrid V8. Sheldon van der Linde will set the
  reference laps. For him and Raffaele Marciello, however, the focus
  quickly shifts to their next challenge: both are travelling directly
  from Bahrain to Macau (CHN), where they will compete next weekend in
  the FIA GT World Cup with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs. Van der Linde will
  drive for Team WRT on the famous Guia street circuit, while Marciello
  will race with ROWE Racing.

“The FIA WEC
  season finale with the eight-hour race in Bahrain turned out to be
  quite a turbulent weekend overall, both in the Hypercar and LMGT3
  classes. In the end, the results were not what we had hoped for, as
  our clear goal was to fight for podium positions in both categories.
  Unfortunately, we simply lacked the pace in the race to do so.
  Nevertheless, we showed a strong performance towards the end, and the
  great battle of the #20 car for eighth place was a satisfying way to
  finish. Sadly, the #15 had to retire due to a loose right-rear wheel.
  In LMGT3, the #31 also achieved a top ten result with seventh place.
  Of course, our goal is to stand on the podium, but finishing in the
  top ten in both categories is still a solid achievement in such a
  fiercely competitive championship. Many thanks to Team WRT, who did an
  excellent job throughout the year in both classes. A big thank you as
  well to everyone at BMW M Motorsport for their hard work, and to all
  our partners for a great FIA WEC season. We will now carefully analyse
  everything and come back stronger next year. Congratulations to
  Ferrari for an incredible season – with their victory at the 24 Hours
  of Le Mans, the manufacturers’ title in the FIA WEC, and the top three
  positions in the drivers’ championship. I think it’s fair to say it
  doesn’t get much better than that. At the same time, I would also like
  to thank Porsche, who are unfortunately leaving the FIA WEC at the end
  of this season. Thank you for the fantastic competition we shared –
  and all the best for the future!”

“Overall, it has been a disappointing weekend. We were hoping
  for a better result here. When you are starting the season the way we
  did, you expect something different, but unfortunately, it did not go
  that way. We have a lot of work ahead of us in the Hypercar class to
  improve for next year. In LMGT3, we just did what we could. We were
  unlucky with the last safety car, otherwise we would have fought for
  P5. But yes, we are not racing to fight for P5. I hope that next year
  we can fight at the very front.”

“Unfortunately, it was not the ending we
  hoped for this year. We would have liked to end the year on a high.
  There was so much potential at points in the season but we just didn‘t
  put it together as we had hoped. But at the same time we’ve learned a
  lot about the team and the car. I feel like we’re stronger than ever
  going into 2026. So the goal remains the same to try and be world
  champions next year, but we have a lot of work to do in the
  off-season. Now I am going to the FIA GT World Cup at Macau, where I
  want to end the year with a success – and it’s a great opportunity to
  achieve my goal to win a world title. But I’ve got some very tough
  competition, firstly with Lello as my fellow BMW driver in the ROWE
  car and then secondly all the other very competitive cars. So the goal
  is to try and win the race. I’ve been there on the podium last year so
  we want to go two steps better.”

“The season went differently to last year when we got
  stronger over the year. This year, we started strong but then it
  became difficult. After Le Mans, the season has been tough, to be
  honest. We will try to investigate what happened in the last races and
  we have some updates on the car, so hopefully this will give us a
  boost to be able to fight for something more. Next up is Macau, and
  that’s always a fantastic race. I won it twice, and last year, I
  nearly won it. So of course we are going there to try to win again.
  I’m pretty strong there, and so is Sheldon. So hopefully one of us can
  bring the victory home.”

“It was a good race. When you see how
  difficult this race was for us last year and how big the step was that
  we made in terms of performance. I think that P5 or P6 would have been
  possible without the last safety car. So well done for the team, the
  step they did was pretty impressive.”

“Unfortunately, my first WEC season with BMW
  was not as successful as we had hoped. There were some highlights with
  the podium finishes in Imola and Austin, but overall, we were always
  in a difficult position in terms of pace. We constantly had to fight
  our way from the back, and that was not ideal over the course of the
  season. However, even though things didn’t go perfectly in the FIA
  WEC, it was still a great first year with BMW overall.”
