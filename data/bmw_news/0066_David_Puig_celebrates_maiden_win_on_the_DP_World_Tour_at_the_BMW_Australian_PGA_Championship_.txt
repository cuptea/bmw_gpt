+++ 23-year-old Spaniard triumphs at Royal Queensland Golf Club
  (Brisbane, AUS) +++ Top-class start to the 2025/26 DP World Tour
  season +++ Daniel Gale (AUS) wins the new BMW M5 Touring with an ace +++

44 years after the unforgettable
  Seve Ballesteros, a Spaniard has once again won the Joe Kirkwood Cup.
  At the first tournament of the new season on the DP World Tour, David
  Puig completed a flawless weekend with victory at the BMW Australian
  PGA Championship. The 23-year-old carded rounds of 68, 67, 65 and 66
  stokes for a with a total score of 266 (-18) at the Royal Queensland
  Golf Club, the venue for the golf competitions at the 2032 Summer
  Olympics. Wenyi Ding (CHN, -16) finished in second place.

Puig put in an impressive performance on the way to his first victory
  on the DP World Tour, recording 13 birdies on his last 40 holes
  without dropping a single shot. Third place was shared by the winner
  of the 2017 BMW Championship, Marc Leishman (AUS), and Nick Voke (NZL,
  both -15). Min Woo Lee (AUS), the 2023 BMW PGA Champion, and Daniel
  Hillier (NZL, both -14) finished tied for fifth place ahead of major
  champion and former world number one Adam Scott (AUS, -13).

“It means the world for sure. I was really looking forward to that
  first professional win on the DP World,” said Puig. "I was pretty
  close a few times throughout the last couple of years, but I wasn’t
  able to get it done. My name being with Seve’s name as the only two
  Spaniards to have won this prestigious event makes it even more special.“

The BMW Australian PGA Championship had already started with a bang.
  In the first round, Australian Daniel Gale (-12, T8) scored an ace on
  the 11th hole (par 3), for which he was rewarded with the Hole in One
  Prize, the all-new BMW M5 Touring. After the round, the 29-year-old
  said that it was a predicted shot: “I played in the pro-am and I said,
  ‘this baby's mine’ – and it actually happened so it’s pretty crazy.“

The BMW PGA Australian Championship was the first of three BMW title
  tournaments on the DP World Tour calendar. It will be followed by the
  BMW International Open (July 1-5, 2026, Golfclub München Eichenried,
  GER) and the ‘Festival of Golf’, the BMW PGA Championship (September
  15-20, 2026, Wentworth Club, ENG). Tickets for the BMW International
  Open are available with a Christmas discount of ten percent until
