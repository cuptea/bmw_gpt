At the Olympic Winter Games 2022, Team
  Germany celebrated twelve gold, ten silver, and five bronze medals.
  The German Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton Federation (BSD) contributed
  the majority of them - nine golds, six silvers, and one bronze in
  Beijing (CHN). It was an outstanding team result that the national
  bobsleigh, skeleton, and luge squads are eager to repeat when the next
  Olympic Winter Games take place in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy
  (6–22 February 2026). Achieving that requires hard work in every area
  and a constant pursuit of optimisation. To this end, the BSD continues
  to rely on its technology partnership with the BMW Group, established
  in 2010.

Drawing on BMW’s expertise, technological capabilities, and
  innovative strength from automotive engineering and motorsport, two
  projects have been advanced for the 2026 Olympics - both designed to
  deliver those decisive fractions of a second in the ice track: the BMW
  Data Coach in luge and customised spike plates for bobsleigh and
  skeleton shoes.

It’s no secret that start times in bobsleigh and skeleton are
  crucial, as they determine the speed athletes carry into the run -
  there’s no “gas pedal” after that. To translate their athletic power
  into acceleration on ice, athletes depend on the right footwear. The
  force is transmitted solely through spike plates on the forefoot, with
  more than 250 small, sharp spikes per shoe gripping the ice and
  converting energy into motion. Any improvement to these plates
  directly enhances performance in the track.

Surprisingly, standard shoes are typically used in bobsleigh and
  skeleton - without considering athletes’ individual preferences or
  anatomical differences. The BMW Group identified optimisation
  potential and, together with the BSD, began developing custom
  spike-plate prototypes ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics for skeleton
  athletes. These plates can be mounted onto any preferred
  track-and-field shoe using existing spike threads for secure fastening.

Manufactured at the BMW Group Additive Manufacturing Campus in
  Munich, the spike plates are produced using 3D printing - a process
  BMW has been employing since 1991 across the entire vehicle lifecycle,
  from concept to production and spare parts. This highly efficient
  process uses a specialised design software that allows fast,
  automated, and athlete-specific generation of 3D-print data.
  Parameters such as geometry, stiffness, and spike shape are customised
  and adapted to each athlete’s shoe using 3D scans. This algorithmic
  design process offers enormous time savings and maximum flexibility as
  plates can be printed, tested, and re-optimised in rapid cycles.

The 3D-printed spike plates made their World Cup debut last season,
  with teams such as Adam Ammour’s using them extensively. However,
  development continued - athlete feedback and summer gait analysis data
  revealed that some athletes performed better with softer soles and
  plates. As a result, a second development track was launched, strongly
  supported by Felix Straub, brakeman for Francesco Friedrich’s team. In
  this version, the plates are milled from nylon, fitted with steel
  spikes, and then glued and riveted to the shoe.

A key material challenge is ensuring the steel spikes withstand
  extreme loads without wearing or breaking. BMW specialists in
  materials and process engineering developed a solution: the spikes are
  plasma-nitrided - a hardening process in which nitrogen is ionized in
  a vacuum at high temperature and diffuses into the steel, improving
  surface hardness. BMW uses this technique for crankshafts in BMW
  Motorrad engines and in motorsport applications.

Now, all athletes on the German bobsleigh and skeleton teams can
  choose between both systems, test them extensively before the
  Olympics, and select their preferred option. After four years of
  development, the result is a range of individualised options for every
  athlete, foot type, shoe model, running style, and push-off position -
  replacing the one-size-fits-all solution.

In luge, the interplay between athlete and sled involves many
  interdependent factors — optimising as many as possible for the best
  run time is the key challenge. The BMW Data Coach delivers a major
  advantage by enabling data-based analysis and optimisation of these
  factors. The ideal interaction varies between athletes and tracks,
  much like individualised car setups in motorsport. For the 2026 Games,
  a new ice track has been built in Cortina, with only a limited number
  of runs available before competition - making data-driven insights
  even more valuable.

Based on measurement and simulation methods, the Data Coach gives
  lugers new ways to fine-tune their sled setup and identify the ideal
  racing line. This approach is well-established in vehicle development
  and motorsport. Since 2016, the BMW Group and BSD have been applying
  and refining these methods in luge.

Special sensors installed in the sled record extensive dynamic data,
  allowing each run to be precisely reconstructed using dedicated
  analysis software. The software was developed by former Junior World
  Champion luger Dr. Julian von Schleinitz, now Head of Tech Excellence
  at the BMW Group, who combines his athletic experience with
  engineering expertise. Over the years, the growing dataset has made
  the BMW Data Coach increasingly effective in identifying optimal lines
  and refining sled setups.

Today, the data volume is so large that - combined with computer
  simulations - it allows predictive testing of new components and
  configurations virtually, before any physical prototype is built or a
  new line is tested on track. This significantly increases efficiency
  and insight within the complex system of sled and athlete.

For the Olympic season, the system - used extensively by 13-time
  World Champion Felix Loch and six-time World Champion Max Langenhan -
  has been further enhanced. The sensors now deliver more precise
  readings on wet ice, and the hardware has been miniaturised to fit
  into a regulation-compliant racing sled. This marks a major step
  forward, as the measurements now come from a sled identical to
  competition equipment.

During the first international training period in Cortina in late
  October and early November, valuable data were already collected.
  These will now be analysed in detail to shape the Olympic race
  strategy. A second test event at the Olympic track in late November
  will offer another opportunity for refinement - before the athletes
  battle for gold in February 2026, where every thousandth of a second counts.
