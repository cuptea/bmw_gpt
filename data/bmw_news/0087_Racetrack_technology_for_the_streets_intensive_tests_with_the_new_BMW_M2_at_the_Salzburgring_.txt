With just a few months remaining until the
  world premiere of the new BMW M2*, the final test phase in the
  development of the new high-performance car is in full swing. The new
  BMW M2 offers thoroughbred racing technology for the roads. In keeping
  with its affinity with the racetrack, the car’s driving dynamics were
  subjected to an intensive test at the Salzburgring in Austria.

The tests focussed on the driving dynamics and chassis, and the new
  BMW M2 impressed with outstanding characteristics. The new production
  car boasts a similar performance level to the BMW M2 CS**, the
  exclusive, special-edition sports car from BMW M GmbH. It allows the
  driver to experience that pure racetrack feeling in any conditions –
  even at the limit.

The power under the bonnet of the BMW M2 is provided by the
  tried-and-tested engines from the M3 and M4 models. The two optional
  transmission types, the manual 6-speed gearbox and 8-speed M
  Steptronic gearbox, guarantee that the power is applied extremely
  dynamically, redefining sheer driving pleasure. The sporty driving
  characteristics are intensified by the adaptive M chassis and the
  rear-wheel drive on the new BMW M2. The powerful brake system comes
  from the M3 and M4 and ensures the power is controlled effortlessly.

The sporty appearance of the new BMW M2 is rounded off by a selection
  of special equipment options. For example, a carbon roof to reduce
  weight, among other benefits. M carbon bucket seats for the driver and
  passenger, also available as an option, emphasise the racing look of
  the new BMW M2.

The world premiere of the new BMW M2 will be in October, followed by
  the market launch in April 2023.
