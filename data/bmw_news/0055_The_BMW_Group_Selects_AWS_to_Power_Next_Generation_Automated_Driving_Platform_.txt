Amazon Web Services (‘’AWS’’) today
  announced the BMW Group has chosen AWS as the preferred cloud provider
  for its automated driving platform. The BMW Group will develop its
  next-generation advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) using AWS to
  help innovate new features for its next generation of vehicles, the
  “Neue Klasse,” set to launch in 2025. The new cloud-based system will
  leverage BMW's pre-existing Cloud Data Hub on AWS, and will use AWS
  compute, generative artificial intelligence (generative AI), Internet
  of Things (IoT), machine learning, and storage capabilities to help
  accelerate the delivery of highly automated BMW vehicles.

“In the next decade, consumer habits and expectations will drive
  more changes in the automotive industry than we’ve seen over the past
  30 years,” said Dr. Nicolai Martin, senior vice president of Driving
  Experience at BMW Group. “This is just the beginning of a new era of
  highly automated driving, fueled by innovations in technology and
  engineering. By collaborating with AWS, the BMW Group, along with our
  partner, Qualcomm Technologies, is building our new automated driving
  platform on AWS’s scalable, secure, and reliable infrastructure. We’re
  tapping into AWS’s ability to help empower the next generation of
  BMW’s automated driving and parking functions.”

ADAS supports today’s drivers with early warning systems and
  capabilities that make driving safer and more comfortable. These
  systems use advanced software and onboard sensors to provide driver
  warnings, automated braking, and steering functions designed to help
  improve a vehicle’s performance on the road. By developing the next
  generation ADAS platform on AWS, the BMW Group’s engineers can respond
  more quickly to customer demands and deliver new features to help
  improve the driving experience. This efficiency, supported by the
  cloud, will help BMW continue to innovate features for its Neue Klasse
  of vehicles and keep drivers focused on the experience on the road.

The BMW Group has also joined Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., to
  co-develop next-generation automated driving systems based on the open
  and modular Snapdragon Ride Platform. The systems feature an
  integrated Ride Vision software stack to enable 360-degree perception
  for the vehicle. Together with AWS and Qualcomm Technologies, the BMW
  Group’s engineers have access to leading hardware, vision software,
  and cloud capabilities in an end-to-end automated driving development
  platform. Placing the BMW Group’s automated driving platform in the
  cloud helps break down development silos within vehicle software teams
  at the BMW Group and helps foster greater global collaboration with
  suppliers to accelerate automated driving innovation.

“As the automotive industry evolves toward a new
  high-performance, low-power, and highly scalable software-defined
  vehicle architecture, we are proud to continue our long-standing,
  strategic cooperation with the BMW Group to codevelop safer and more
  secure AI-powered driver assistance technologies at scale,” said Nakul
  Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of Automotive and
  Cloud Computing at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. "The Qualcomm®
  Cloud AI 100 solution and Snapdragon Ride Platforms help deliver
  automotive innovation to the BMW Group and leading brands across the
  globe.  This strategic relationship with AWS and BMW brings together
  leading-edge technologies from our respective industries to deliver a
  modern cloud-native software development environment."

The BMW Group will also use AWS to help scale its capacity to
  handle vast increases in data creation and usage within automated
  driving feature development. As automakers deploy higher-level
  automated driving functions, such as adaptive cruise control, parking
  assist, and piloted driving, the vehicles create more data for
  engineering teams to analyze and utilize within future feature
  development. This cloud-based infrastructure will help provide the
  foundation for the BMW Group to develop and deliver new functions for
  its vehicles, such as lane departure assist, automated lane change, or
  hands-free driving functions, even faster.

AWS services will help power this new scalable, automated
  driving platform based on a common reference architecture,
  accelerating the development life cycle and broadening it across BMW
  models. For example, the platform provides the framework needed to
  process, catalog, and store millions of miles of real-time driving
  data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Engineers and data
  scientists can then search, identify, and visualize relevant driving
  scenes to develop and train models using Amazon SageMaker, AWS’s
  service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models
  in the cloud and on the edge. Engineers can also develop large-scale
  simulations on AWS compute instances for verification. With this
  approach, the BMW Group can test and validate new software versions
  more efficiently, helping to ensure the system’s safety and shortening
  time to market.

“Automated driving is about more than just convenience; it’s
  also aimed at providing driver assistance technology that helps
  prevents injuries and saves lives,” said Wendy Bauer, general manager
  of Automotive and Manufacturing at AWS. “Implementing these systems on
  the BMW Group’s international scale requires an approach that can
  process and analyze vast amounts of data, as well as learn and
  innovate, so automakers can develop safer and more reliable automated
  and ADAS systems. Working with AWS and Qualcomm Technologies, the BMW
  Group has the tools required to help make its vision of providing
  safe, premium quality, high performance, and highly automated driving
  functions to its customers a reality.”
