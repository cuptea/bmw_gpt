Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good morning,

The BMW Group remains on track and confirms its targets for 2024,
  despite the volatile market environment.

After a successful start to the year, we again achieved an EBIT
  margin for the Automotive Segment within our full year target range of
  8-10 percent in the second quarter, thanks to our attractive product portfolio.

At the same time, we are continuing to invest in our future model
  line-up and securing the company’s long-term competitiveness.

As of June, BMW Group global sales remained on par with last year.

The BMW brand grew by 2.3 percent globally or 6.2 percent if we
  exclude the Chinese market.

Global growth drivers are our all-electric vehicles and models from
  the upper premium segment, both of which saw a double-digit increase.

The Group EBT margin came in at 10.5 percent for the second quarter
  and 10.9 percent for the first half-year.

The Automotive EBIT margin reached 8.4 percent in the second quarter
  and 8.6 percent for the half-year, both within our full year target
  range of 8 to 10 percent.

Excluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price
  allocation of BBA, the margins came in at 9.4 percent for the second
  quarter and 9.6 percent through six months.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The BMW Group is committed to maintaining its strategic focus.

We have a clear plan and a long-term strategy that we are
  implementing systematically.

At the same time, we remain highly flexible in our execution and are
  able to respond swiftly to market developments.

This enables our operating business to deliver consistently good results.

Let’s take a look at the financial figures in the second quarter in
  more detail, starting with a brief overview of the Group.

BMW Group revenues were on par with the previous year.

Group earnings before tax totalled around 3.9 billion euros,
  resulting in a Group EBT margin of 10.5 percent.

On this slide you can see how the Automotive Segment performed across
  key figures.

In the second quarter, the BMW Group delivered approximately 619,000
  BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers.

The BMW brand reported sales growth of 2.2 percent.

MINI, on the other hand, saw a significant decrease from the previous
  year, due to the planned model changeover across the entire product range.

However, in the second half of the year, the brand will benefit from
  the ramp-up of the New MINI Family, with the Countryman* and Cooper*,
  both available in several drivetrains, as well as the all-electric Aceman*.

We continue to see sales growth of our all-electric vehicles.

The BMW Group delivered about 108,000 BEVs to customers in the second
  quarter. This represents 17.4 percent of our total sales.

Our electrified vehicles – in other words, BEVs, plus plug-in hybrids
  – accounted for almost 24 percent of total sales in the second quarter.

Segment revenues increased slightly by 1.4 percent.

Adjusted for currency translation effects, revenues saw an increase
  of 2.1 percent.

The significant growth in all-electric vehicles and models from the
  upper premium segment contributed to this. The current trend is also
  expected to have a positive effect on revenues for the remainder of 2024.

Revenue per wholesale unit across the entire product portfolio is
  expected to be in line with last year’s level.

EBIT for the period from April to June totalled 2.7 billion euros.

The EBIT margin came in at 8.4 percent for the quarter and 8.6
  percent for the half-year.

Excluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price
  allocation of BBA, the EBIT margin was 9.4 percent for the second
  quarter and 9.6 percent through six months.

That brings me to the EBIT bridge, to explain in more detail the
  changes in the operating result, compared to the second quarter of the
  previous year.

The net balance of currency and commodity positions provided a
  tailwind of 500 million euros over last year’s second quarter.

For the full year 2024, we anticipate a positive net balance from
  currency and commodity positions.

This is expected to nearly offset material cost headwinds. However,
  we see additional requests for supply chain support.

The net balance of volume, model mix and pricing effects in the
  second quarter was about 300 million euros lower year-on-year.

Volume development and the model mix made a positive contribution to this.

The global price environment for new and used cars continued to
  normalise in the second quarter.

The Chinese market, in particular, remains highly competitive.

For the full year 2024, we expect the net effect from volumes, model
  mix and prices to be neutral over last year.

Research and development expenses increased by about 100 million
  euros compared to the prior-year quarter.

The BMW Group's research and development expenditure remained at a
  high level through the end of June, totalling almost 4.2 billion euros.

The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was at 5.7
  percent after the first six months.

The capitalization ratio for development costs, which is relevant for
  R&D costs according to IFRS, was 34 percent in the second quarter
  and 30.8 percent as of June.

Selling and administrative expenses increased by around 100 million
  euros compared to the previous year, primarily driven by personnel
  costs and expenses for IT projects.

The headwind of 200 million euros from Other Cost Changes can mainly
  be attributed to manufacturing costs. Here, inflation in material
  costs continues to have an impact.

Free cash flow in the Automotive Segment totalled 1 billion euros in
  the second quarter.

The change in working capital, amounting to 500 million euros, is
  largely due to the planned increase in inventory levels. This ensures
  we can continue to meet global demand for our products in the second
  half of the year.

The net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free
  cash flow by 400 million euros in the second quarter.

Total investments for April to June amounted to around 2.6 billion euros.

The capex ratio came in at 5.8 percent for the second quarter and 4.7
  percent for the half-year.

As in the previous years, the major share of capital expenditure will
  occur in the second half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter.

We expect a capex ratio of more than six percent for the full year.

Changes to provisions positively impacted free cash flow in the
  second quarter by around 100 million euros.

The change in the position Other of around 800 million euros mainly
  reflects regular tax payments.

After the first six months, Automotive Segment free cash flow had
  reached just over 2.3 billion euros.

The difference in free cashflow compared to 2023 is due to the capex
  increase of around 1 billion euros.

We expect to see a positive contribution from a reduction in working capital.

For the full year, we are targeting a free cash flow of over six
  billion euros.

Since 2022, we have made a paradigm shift in our shareholder return
  strategy by adding a share buyback programme that supplements our
  annual dividend payout.

In doing so, we have increased the payout ratio of Automotive Free
  Cashflow by paying dividends in our target corridor of 30 to 40
  percent as well as using the share buyback program.

BMW AG is continuing with its share repurchase programme as planned.
  At the end of June, it had acquired shares equivalent to 5.51 percent
  of the existing share capital as of June 30th.

The second tranche of the second programme, totalling 500 million
  euros, was completed in June.

The third tranche of 500 million euros, which began in June, will be
  concluded no later than December 31st.

By the end of 2024, BMW AG will have repurchased shares valued at 1.5
  billion euros as part of the second programme, which amounts to 2
  billion euros.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The BMW Group has a solid and robust balance sheet, confirming the
  company's considerable financial strength.

This is also underscored by our net financial assets in the
  automotive business, which totalled just over 43 billion euros.

Starting with the Half-Year Report 2024, we are changing the way we
  report net financial assets in our automotive business.

In addition to the Automotive Segment’s NFA that was previously
  reported, the new figure also includes the NFA of holding companies
  within the Other Entities Segment, which receive regular distributions
  from their subsidiaries.

I trust that this new, comprehensive definition of Net Financial
  Assets provides you with useful additional information.

Let’s move on to the Financial Services Segment.

Here, the positive trend in new business continues – for financing of
  both new and used vehicles.

A total of about 850,000 new leasing and credit financing contracts
  were concluded in the first half-year. This represents a significant
  increase of 16.5 percent year-over-year.

The volume of new business, encompassing all new credit financing and
  leasing contracts, climbed 18.2 percent to around 32 billion euros.

This positive development in new business is also reflected in the
  portfolio. The total value of all contracts managed surpassed 143
  billion euros for the first time.

Segment earnings amounted to just under 1.5 billion euros. This
  year-on-year decrease of 13.1 percent resulted mainly from lower
  income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, which reflects the
  continued normalisation of the used car market.

During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio for the entire
  credit portfolio was 0.25 percent (2023: 0.15 percent).

The segment’s overall business performance was better than
  anticipated. For this reason, we are raising our full-year guidance
  for Return on Equity (RoE) from a range between 14 and 17 percent to a
  range between 15 and 18 percent.

In the Motorcycles Segment, second-quarter deliveries increased by
  2.6 percent compared to the prior-year quarter.

EBIT in the second quarter totalled 110 million euros, with an EBIT
  margin of 11.1 percent.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

the BMW Group is on course to meet its targets for the year.

The market development in China in the first half of this year has
  not met our expectations.

We expect that the various measures taken by the government,
  including the cut in lending rates in July, will lead to a
  stabilisation of the market starting in the third quarter.

Our overall business environment will remain challenging throughout
  the rest of the year.

Our guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions
  will not deteriorate.

Group earnings before tax will decrease slightly.

We expect to see a slight increase in demand, with sales in the
  Automotive Segment slightly higher than the previous year. The
  percentage of all-electric vehicles will increase significantly.

We are targeting an EBIT margin between 8 and 10 percent and a Return
  on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 15 and 20 percent.

Deliveries are projected to increase slightly in the Motorcycles
  Segment. The EBIT margin should come in between 8 and 10 percent, with
  a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 21 and 26 percent.

In the Financial Services Segment we are now forecasting a Return on
  Equity (RoE) in the range of 15 to 18 percent for the full year.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The BMW Group is pursuing a clear strategic approach, focused on
  long-term success.

Our company maintains a globally balanced footprint. We are
  leveraging this balance and the high flexibility of all our systems to
  mitigate market volatility and consistently provide our customers with
  the best products to suit their needs.

We continue to systematically implement our electrification and
  digitalisation strategy and make targeted investments in our future
  model line-up.

In 2024, we are setting a decisive course for our future. Research
  and development spending and capital expenditure will therefore
  respectively peak, as planned.

We expect our R&D ratio for the full year to exceed five percent,
  with a capex ratio of more than six percent.

Despite these high upfront investments, we were still able to deliver
  a solid financial performance in the second quarter, thanks to our
  attractive product range.

Across global markets, we are carefully steering our performance in
  line with individual market conditions.

At the same time, we are maintaining a high level of cost discipline.

Whether manufacturing costs, fixed costs, or capital expenditure: at
  the BMW Group, we have always constantly optimized our cost structures
  and will continue to do so.

I am confident that our clear long-term strategy, combined with
  focused execution in our operational business, will keep us
  competitive and successful – both now and in the future.

Thank you.
