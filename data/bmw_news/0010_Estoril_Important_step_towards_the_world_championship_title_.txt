Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) also showed strong form at
  Estoril. In Saturday’s first race, he was caught up in a multi-rider
  incident at the first corner through no fault of his own. He was able
  to take part in the restart but faced technical issues and finished
  15th. In the Superpole race, he secured an important ninth place to
  improve his grid position for race two, where he finished tenth – once
  again inside the top ten.

In the manufacturers’ standings, BMW remains hot on the heels of
  leaders Ducati, trailing by just three points ahead of the final
  round. A total of 62 points will still be up for grabs in the last
  three races of the season at Jerez de la Frontera.

“It was
  another important step towards the title and an almost perfect weekend
  for us. With two victories and a second place, we can now travel to
  Jerez with a very solid points advantage. Toprak’s performance was
  once again outstanding. At the same time, Nicolò Bulega’s performance
  also deserves recognition. What those two showed in the races, pulling
  away from the rest of the field, was on another level. We are also
  very happy with Mickey’s performance; he did a great job with his
  top-ten results. I think he too is ready for his, for now, last race
  weekend in WorldSBK. We will now do everything we can – in Berlin,
  Munich, England, and at the track – to be as well prepared as
  possible, and we’re looking forward to the season finale.”

“It was another fantastic weekend with two wins,
  pole position, lap records, and a second place. With this tremendous
  weekend, Toprak extended his lead in the riders’ championship – a
  maximum success that the entire team can be proud of. Toprak showed
  his professionalism in every race, and in the second main race he knew
  that second place was also crucial for the championship, for the big
  goal. He didn’t take any unnecessary risks to go for the win. Looking
  ahead to Jerez, we are excited for an intense finale, and we want to
  express our gratitude to the organisers and the FIM, whose control and
  regulatory mechanisms ensure fair competition that thrills fans at the
  track and on TV with two magnificent riders at the front.”

“I was really happy to win the first race. At the
  beginning, all was under control but then Nicolò had a bit more grip
  than me. At the end of the race I was spinning a lot but he was too.
  In the Superpole race, the start was a bit difficult, I was fighting
  with Nicolò on the first two laps. But then I just focused on my pace,
  pushing for a good lap time and trying to not make any mistake. So in
  the end I won again. Race two was more difficult for me. I was back in
  fifth, had to overtake but just focused on my job to catch Nicolò.
  When I was back in second place I was pushing so hard on every lap
  that the rear tyre dropped, so I was struggling a lot. I had to start
  to manage my race and I just thought: ‘Okay, this time it is
  impossible to win, P2 is enough because I need the good points for the
  championship.’ Now I am looking forward to Jerez. We have some margin
  in the championship, and everything else we will see there. Nicolò is
  very strong at Jerez but I will try to do my best again.”

“At the last couple of rounds we had a great feeling
  with the bike and then we came here and for some reason we struggled
  quite a lot with the bike in the beginning. We couldn’t get the right
  feeling and not the right speed on Friday. For Saturday morning, we
  improved our pace and our package a lot. I was confident for Superpole
  but unfortunately I lost a lot of time by missing a gear. Especially
  here you lose a lot of places on the grid and P12 was not fantastic.
  In race one, I had a good start, but unfortunately someone crashed in
  turn one and took me out. The guys in the pit box made sure that the
  spare bike was ready and I was able to do the re-start. After a few
  good laps I unfortunately had a technical issue. I managed to finish
  the race and score one point, but it was a very disappointing
  Saturday. In Sunday’s Superpole race we decided to go with the race
  tyre as we felt that the qualifying tyre was a big risk. I finished P9
  which was not too bad. It was good to move up on the grid, especially
  for turn one. My start in race two was not great but I had a good
  pace. I was catching up with the guys in front of me, but I just
  seemed to struggle a bit with the bike when I got really close to
  them. I was fighting hard and finished tenth collecting more points.
  Now I’m looking forward to Jerez, especially in regards of the
  championship. It looks like Toprak will win it there, so that’s the
  thing everyone is looking out for.”
