BMW M GmbH once again achieved outstanding
  sales growth in 2025. For no less than the 14th time in a row, the
  manufacturer of high-performance and performance vehicles reported
  record sales. And for the 7th time running, BMW M GmbH vehicles
  outsold their competitors by a considerable margin. A sales total of
  213,457 vehicles surpassed the previous year’s excellent result
  (206,582 vehicles) by three per cent. Both the high-performance and
  performance models set new benchmarks. Keys to success in all markets
  are a state-of-the-art model range spanning many vehicle classes and
  an extensive portfolio of powertrain options. In 2025, nearly every
  tenth BMW sold was a BMW M model. This share of 9.8 per cent
  represents another milestone.

“Our 14th consecutive sales record validates our strategy. We will
  continue to offer performance and high-performance vehicles across the
  entire BMW model range. With fully electric, partly electric and
  all-ICE powertrains,” says Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH.

The high-performance models from BMW M GmbH
  combine racetrack capabilities with unrestricted everyday usability.
  BMW M5 models became key growth drivers in 2025. The BMW M5 Sedan
  (energy consumption, weighted, combined: 17.6–17.2 kWh/100 km and
  5.0–4.8 l/100 km (WLTP); CO

emissions, weighted, combined:
  114–108 g/km (WLTP); CO

classes: with discharged battery
  G, weighted, combined C; fuel consumption with discharged battery:
  10.7–10.5 l/100 km (WLTP))*

and the BMW M5 Touring
  (energy consumption, weighted, combined: 18.1–17.6 kWh/100 km and
  5.3–5.0 l/100 km (WLTP); CO

emissions, weighted, combined:
  119–114 g/km (WLTP); CO

classes: with discharged battery
  G, weighted, combined D–C; fuel consumption with discharged battery:
  10.9–10.7 l/100 km (WLTP))*

saw enormous sales increases
  in their first full year on the markets, making them key contributors
  to the success of BMW M GmbH. Both vehicles offer a model-specific
  version of the M HYBRID system with a peak output of 535 kW/727 hp and
  a maximum system torque of 1,000 Nm. A high-revving V8 engine with M
  TwinPower Turbo technology and an electric motor combine with an
  eight-speed M Steptronic transmission to provide power to the M xDrive
  all-wheel drive system. The great appeal of the BMW M5 Touring was
  underscored by a “Golden Steering Wheel” award. This accolade is
  awarded by “Auto Bild” and “Bild am Sonntag”, both published by the
  German Axel Springer SE publishing house. The high-performance model
  achieved the highest points score of all finalists in the competition.
  Moreover, the distinguished jury rated the BMW M5 Touring ahead of the
  other class finalists in all driving disciplines, as well as in terms
  of efficiency and value for money.

The BMW M2 Coupé (fuel consumption, combined: 10.2–9.7 l/100 km;
  CO

emissions, combined: 230–221 g/km (WLTP),
  CO

class: G)* was the best-selling high-performance
  vehicle of 2025. This model is also available with a manual
  transmission (fuel consumption, combined: 10.2–9.7 l/100 km;
  CO

emissions, combined: 230–221 g/km (WLTP),
  CO

class: G)* and as an even more track-focused BMW M2 CS
  special model (fuel consumption, combined: 10.0 l/100 km;
  CO

emissions, combined: 226 g/km (WLTP), CO

class: G)*. This delivers 390 kW/530 hp of power and recently set a
  new record time of 7:25.5 minutes on the Nürburgring.

The BMW M3 models are another family of
  high-performance best-sellers. The series impresses with perfectly
  tailored model variants and includes sedans with various output
  levels. The BMW M3 entry-level model is a particularly purist vehicle
  that comes with a six-speed manual transmission and 353 kW/480 hp of
  power (fuel consumption, combined: 10.1 l/100 km; CO

emissions, combined: 230–229 g/km (WLTP), CO

class: G)*.
  Then there are the extremely popular Touring variants. 2025 also saw
  the launch of the BMW M3 CS Touring (fuel consumption, combined: 10.5
  l/100 km; CO

emissions, combined: 238 g/km (WLTP),
  CO

class: G)*, the most sporting exemplar with 405 kW/551
  hp. The large number of BMW M3 family sales is a clear sign of the
  model series’ continued allure and represents a major contribution to
  the new record of almost 71,500 high-performance vehicles sold.

A
  particularly popular model and also the best-selling BMW M GmbH
  vehicle of 2025 was the BMW X3 M50 (fuel consumption, combined: 8.3
  l/100 km; CO

emissions, combined: 189 g/km (WLTP);
  CO

class: G)*. The top athlete in the premium mid-size SAV
  segment offers unique performance capabilities and a charismatic
  appearance. The M TwinPower Turbo engine, combined with 48-volt mild
  hybrid technology, delivers a maximum system output of 293 kW/398 hp.
  The power of the BMW X3 M50 is complemented by specific chassis
  technology and signature M design elements. With these attributes, it
  overtook the BMW i4 and its M60 Gran Coupé xDrive variant (energy
  consumption, combined (WLTP): 20.9 kWh/100 km; CO

emissions, combined (WLTP): 0 g/km, CO

class: A)*, which
  delivers an output of 442 kW/601 hp and a range of up to 551 km. The
  electric BMW i4 range-topper was the best-selling BMW M GmbH model
  from 2022 to 2024.

In 2025, nearly every tenth BMW sold was a BMW M model, and the sales
  share of 9.8 per cent (9.4 per cent in the year prior) represents
  another new record. BMW M vehicles are especially popular in
  Switzerland, where nearly every fourth BMW ordered is a BMW M model.

In the key markets, BMW M GmbH vehicles led the
  field, beating their competitors by a considerable margin. The models
  were particularly coveted in the U.S., the largest single market at
  over 72,000 units sold. But BMW M models also achieved top positions
  in markets such as Canada, Germany, Korea, South Africa and the United
  Kingdom. In China, BMW M GmbH achieved its largest absolute sales increase.

The state-of-the-art model portfolio with its
  comprehensive range of ICE, plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles
  is at the heart of BMW M GmbH success. The development of models based
  on the Neue Klasse will provide further momentum. “Our strategy of
  being open towards new technologies once again paid off in 2025. BMW M
  GmbH stands for optimal performance, independently of the powertrain
  type. In all markets and across all vehicle classes. Customers looking
  for a performance or high-performance vehicle will always find it at
  BMW M GmbH”, says Sylvia Neubauer, Vice President Customer, Brand,
  Sales at BMW M GmbH.

The BMW M Motorsport race cars – the BMW M Hybrid
  V8, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M4 GT4 EVO – achieved a total of
  more than 180 victories in 2025. In works motorsport, the BMW M Hybrid
  V8 delivered a competitive performance in the first half of the FIA
  WEC season and the BMW M GmbH marks 14th consecutive record year. The
  best result of a season marked by highs and lows was the 1-2 finish at
  Road America. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO had a tremendous season. While the
  1-2 victory at the Bathurst 12 Hour race in Australia was still won by
  the predecessor model, the EVO version seamlessly continued the series
  with top results. Triumphs at the Nürburgring 24 Hours (Germany), the
  Suzuka 1000 (Japan), the Indianapolis 8 Hour race and in the GTD Pro
  Class at the 6 Hours of the Glen and the Petit Le Mans (both U.S.) are
  among the highlights of a season that saw over 80 victories and 100
  further podium finishes.

Teams driving the BMW M4 GT4 EVO achieved over 100 victories in the
  2025 season. More than any other model, the BMW M4 GT4 is associated
  with customer racing. The victory in the SP10 at the Nürburgring 24
  Hours was a particular high point. In the Nürburgring
  Langstrecken-Serie (NLS) racing series, these vehicles came out on top
  in nine out of ten races. Moreover, the BMW M4 GT4 EVO triumphed in
  all classes at the GT4 America. The strong results of the GT4 teams
  helped BMW M Motorsport secure the SRO manufacturers’ title in the GT4
  segment. The 2026 season will see the debut of the BMW M2 Racing as a
  new entry-level vehicle complementing the model portfolio for customer racing.
