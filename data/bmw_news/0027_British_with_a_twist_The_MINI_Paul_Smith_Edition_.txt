Paul Smith and MINI – two
  traditional British brands have taken their partnership to the next
  level and created something great: The new MINI Paul Smith Edition.
  Following the MINI STRIP in 2021 and the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith
  in 2022, the British designer is now bringing his world-famous design
  language – ‘Classic with a twist’ – to the new MINI family. Whether
  electric or combustion engine, the edition will be available for all
  MINI Cooper 3-door, 5-door and Convertible models, with the exception
  of the John Cooper Works models. The look and details not only show
  Paul Smith’s signature style — but also the brands playful, optimistic
  and independent spirit. The MINI Paul Smith Edition celebrates its
  world premiere on October 29 at Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo.

“It’s not often that you see two icons of British design work
  together in this way and it’s wonderful that our partnership has
  carried on over so many years. The MINI Paul Smith Edition has been a
  real privilege and a wonderful opportunity… new colours and new
  unexpected details that will be a welcomed surprise,” adds Sir Paul
  Smith, expressing his thoughts on the collaboration and the new design.

Combining MINI design with Paul Smith’s
  distinctive style: Exclusive exterior colours, sophisticated accents
  and unexpected details bring the shared history of MINI and Paul Smith
  into the present.

"MINI and Paul Smith embody a shared mindset of positivity,
  embracing the motto of this edition: 'Every day is a new beginning.'
  Our collaboration celebrates a mutual love for design and meticulous
  attention to detail. Unexpected elements, such as the 'hello'
  projection on the ground and Paul Smith’s handwritten inscription
  bring a smile to your face right upon entering the car," says
  Holger Hampf, Head of MINI Design.

The MINI Paul Smith Edition offers a choice of three exterior paint
  finishes, two of which are edition-exclusive: Statement Grey is a
  modern interpretation of the classic Mini Austin Seven colour from
  1959 – a clear, bluish-tinted grey shade and self-confident statement
  of timeless modernity. Inspired White is a contemporary homage to the
  popular Classic Mini Beige colour, and finally the elegant and classic
  Midnight Black Metallic from the current MINI Family.

Regardless of the body colour, the specially created Nottingham Green
  paintwork – a tribute to Sir Paul's hometown – adds sophisticated
  accents to the side mirrors, the octagonal radiator grille, the wheel
  hub covers with Paul Smith lettering and as the paintwork for one of
  the two roof variants.

In addition to the colour variants, numerous details characterise
  Paul Smith's signature and make the MINI Paul Smith Edition
  unmistakable: The ‘Signature Stripe’, a central design feature of the
  British designer, adorns the roof in Nottingham Green at the rear of
  the driver's side. The alternative version of the roof features
  elegant stripes in Jet Black in varying thickness, both matte and
  glossy. The MINI Cooper Convertible Paul Smith Edition is supplied
  with a black soft top.

All edition vehicles are equipped with 18-inch Night Flash Spoke
  black aluminium wheels with tinted clear coat in Dark Steel. The MINI
  logo at the front and rear is offered in newly designed Black Blue and
  complements the colour composition of Paul Smith and MINI. On the
  black horizontal handle strip at the rear, Paul Smith's signature
  refers to the creative spirit behind the vehicle design.

British character is also reflected in the interior with numerous
  components featuring a modern, elegant look. The knitted surfaces on
  the dashboard and door panels appear in black, while Paul Smith
  fabrics in tone-on-tone stripe patterns serve as inspiration for the
  special structure of the dashboard. The Nightshade Blue sports seats
  are made of Vescin and have knitted textile in the shoulder and
  headrest areas. Drawn from the Signature Stripe, the decorative
  stitching on the steering wheel's textile band is designed in bright
  colours - quintessentially Paul Smith.

The round display in the centre of the cockpit also appears with one
  of three different Paul Smith backgrounds when Personal Mode is
  selected. Small hidden details underline the British design influence
  - but also the playful character of the designer: when the door is
  opened, the driver and front passenger are greeted with a handwritten
  ‘Hello’ as a light projection on the floor and Smith's motto ‘Every
  day is a new beginning’ on the door sill, reflecting the positive
  mindset of both brands.  A graphic of a stylized ‘rabbit’ hand-drawn
  by Paul Smith on the floor mat complete the interior details.

MINI and Sir Paul
  Smith: two icons that are not only linked by their British heritage
  but also look back on exclusive collaborations resulting in unique
  styling. Their joint creative success story began in 1998, when the
  designer created a limited edition of the classic Mini: a specially
  created blue colour and matching anthracite-coloured alloy wheels lent
  the iconic model the signature of Paul Smith.

To mark the 40th birthday of the classic MINI in 1999, the fashion
  designer dipped an exclusive one-off in his characteristic stripe
  design, using 86 stripes in 26 colours.

In 2021, the MINI STRIP celebrated its world premiere: a vehicle
  designed using only what Paul Smith considered absolutely necessary.
  The result was a customised one-off car that despite its minimalist
  design and in keeping with Smith's guiding principle of ‘classic with
  a twist’, was not without unexpected and loving details.

In 2022, Paul Smith went back to the roots of the collaboration with
  the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith. A classic found its way into the
  now: a Classic Mini from the 1998 MINI Paul Smith Edition was
  transformed into a modernised electric vehicle. With a focus on
  quality and functionality, a contemporary vehicle was created that can
  also be seen as a tribute to the tradition and heritage of the classic MINI.

But it is not only Sir Paul Smith who inspires MINI with
  creative ideas - the inspiration also works in reverse: the designer
  repeatedly uses MINI as a motif on exclusive pieces in his
  collections. To celebrate the launch of the MINI Paul Smith Edition,
  Paul Smith will release a capsule collection of bags inspired by
  details from the latest MINI collaboration.
