Summary:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2023 FIM Superbike World Championship opens with two back-to-back overseas events for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. This weekend (24th to 26th February), Phillip Island in Australia hosts the opening round of the season. Just one week later (3rd to 5th March), the WorldSBK circus is at Mandalika, Indonesia, for round two.

The new generation of the BMW M 1000 RR was launched in October 2022
  and serves as the basis for the World Superbike for the 2023 season.
  The new bike’s aerodynamics, in particular, have undergone
  comprehensive optimisation. At the same time, BMW Motorrad Motorsport
  has spent the winter developing specific racing components to be used
  in WorldSBK.

The two teams completed their pre-season preparations with the
  official tests at Phillip Island on Monday and Tuesday. The teams and
  the four riders used both days to fine-tune their bikes ahead of the
  opening races.

“After a short and busy winter break, we now get back down to
  the serious business with two back-to-back race weekends. We are very
  excited about the races at Phillip Island and Mandalika. It is always
  challenging when you compete with a new bike – particularly as the
  WorldSBK has an extremely strong field this year and will be very
  competitive. However, we are confident: we have optimised our bike,
  our teams are doing an outstanding job, and our four riders are among
  the best in the field. For us, the two teams and the four riders, it
  is now important to establish a good basis in Australia and Indonesia,
  on which we can then build over the course of the season.”

“It has been the final test before 2023 officially
  starts. It was a good three out of four sessions. I feel like we made
  a lot of progress and we have a lot of information from the last two
  days. Only in the final session, we had some issues. In general, I
  think we know what we need to do for the weekend coming up. The bike
  feels good and I know that we can make more progress. There were more
  positives than negatives and that’s all that matters. At the first two
  rounds, I just want to have everything working well and I think at
  this point being in the top ten would be a really good result. I
  either want to be close to the best BMW or the best BMW. I think
  that’s the main goal. Overall, I want to be in the top ten for sure,
  and hopefully we can prepare the bike for these first two rounds in a
  way that we can make it happen.”

“At the test, we have worked on getting some more
  feeling with the bike and as the track started to have more grip I
  started to feel better. We tried a few things to help with the rear
  grip again and we worked on electronics to get me more feeling in that
  area of the bike. We still have some work to do. Now we start the
  season with a double-header. I am not feeling super confident yet but
  it is coming slowly the more I ride the bike. The field is super close
  at the moment. When you look at the lap times, it is super close with
  everybody. So it will be difficult to say what the targets for the
  first two rounds are and the race is obviously different to testing. I
  would be happy to get some top-six finishes in the first races.
  Overall, we just need to play it by ear and see where we are after the
  first race to improve on that.”

“It was nice to have another two days of
  testing. We had a solid plan, tried a lot of things, mainly with the
  electronics but also with the suspension. We did not change the bike
  completely but it was just small things we wanted to try and
  re-confirm. It has been good days of testing but as always in testing
  you want more time, but I think we can be quite happy. We had no
  problems so I am starting the weekend quite confident. At the first
  two rounds, we for sure need to be in the top ten. It seems that the
  midfield in WorldSBK is really tight now and I think we can expect
  some really good battles but we improved the bike a lot over the
  winter, step by step. Maybe not in the single-lap pace but over race
  distance and feeling for us. So I am looking forward to start the
  season. To be racing at Phillip Island and in Indonesia is amazing,
  two really good but completely different tracks. For me, the winter
  has been long enough and I can’t wait to start racing.”

“We were struggling a little bit throughout these two days,
  but had a good session on Monday morning, where I felt good straight
  away. After that we couldn’t really improve and had some problems with
  the bike. Luckily, it was a test. I would rather have these issues on
  Monday and Tuesday than Friday to Sunday. I want to say a huge thank
  you to all the guys, because it was two very long days for them now.
  They put in a lot of effort, we all did. We just have to continue like
  this. It is difficult to say what I expect from the first two rounds.
  If I manage to reach the team’s target, the top ten, in these two
  first rounds, I will be happy.”
