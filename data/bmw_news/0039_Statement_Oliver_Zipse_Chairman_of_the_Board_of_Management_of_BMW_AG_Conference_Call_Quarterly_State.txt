Ladies and Gentlemen,

The figures for the first quarter of 2024 underline once again that:
  Our strategy for long-term, profitable growth is robust and effective
  – especially in the dynamic environment in which we operate.

These conditions are the same for all players within our industry.
  However, there are currently three distinct groups of commercial
  actors, each with their own approach.

1. The newcomers: the ones who generate a lot of hype with single
  products. They often have only individual technological highlights,
  such as maximum performance, the largest range or the largest
  screen.

It remains to be seen whether the overall package will
  meet high customer expectations, especially in the premium segment,
  over the entire lifecycle.

Additionally, they face the challenge
  of managing complexity as they scale up and expand. Market entry is
  also bought with aggressive price positioning.

2. Then, there are the established manufacturers, who are trying to
  copy these new players’ approach, but run the risk of losing their own identity.

3. And, finally, there are a number of manufacturers who are
  struggling to keep pace with change – and therefore remain entrenched
  in their traditional business models.

In this competitive space, the BMW Group continues to chart its own,
  balanced course.

And we remain true to ourselves.

We analyse and anticipate both current and future trends without
  prejudging the outcome. From this, we develop our strategic
  approaches. The ability to respond to market developments, customer
  needs and new technological approaches is essential.

This has earned us a leading position in e-mobility and, at the same
  time, allowed us to maintain consistently high profitability, even in
  a volatile environment.

For nine quarters in a row, our EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment
  has been within our target range of 8 - 10 percent or higher, like it
  was in the first quarter of 2023. Walter Mertl already explained the
  reasons for this.

Our development efforts are focused on technologies that deliver real
  added value for our customers. Decades of market experience have
  taught us what our customers want throughout the entire customer
  journey. We use this knowledge and our technological expertise to
  create the perfect overall concept.

This is not easy to replicate.

The BMW Group is also one of the few “true” global players in the
  automotive industry. From production, to sales, to suppliers – we are
  in a strong position in all major markets.

We have well established footprints in each region along with a
  local-for-local mindset.

This global approach is our greatest strength. It creates resilience,
  opens up opportunities and keeps us flexible.

We are building on this to leverage our business success – today and
  in the future.

A look at global regions shows that markets and customer demand
  continue to develop in a highly diversified way. Maintaining a
  presence in all major sales markets enables us to balance out these
  different trends.

Our unique BMW approach allows us to respond flexibly to changing
  demand, especially when it comes to drive technologies.

But let me be quite clear: We continue to ramp up e-mobility at a
  fast pace that our competitors can barely keep up with.

Just a few weeks ago, we hit an important milestone: Since the market
  launch of the BMW i3, we have delivered more than one million
  all-electric vehicles to customers. This confirms the appeal of our
  fully-electric product range.

This is also backed up by our current figures in the Chinese BEV
  market. With growth of more than 18% in China in the first quarter,
  BMW outperformed both the total market for electric vehicles and the
  electric premium segment.

This means: We are gaining segment share in the world’s biggest
  e-mobility market.

However, our success in China is not just evident from the numbers.
  The BMW Group is held in high regard there as a "local player".

I experienced this when I was part of the business delegation led by
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in April. And we were also very pleased
  that Premier Li Qiang took the time to visit the BMW Group stand at
  Auto China in Beijing.

We are confident about long-term economic prospects in China. We are
  therefore comprehensively preparing our joint venture BBA's production
  site in Shenyang for future vehicle models.

In late April, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding to this effect
  in Shenyang, for investments totalling around 2.5 billion euros.

Our highly diversified electric offering, across BMW, MINI and
  Rolls-Royce, is not just in demand in China, but worldwide.

With sales up by about 28 percent, fully-electric vehicles once again
  made an important contribution to the BMW Group's sales growth and
  earnings in the first quarter of 2024.

At Auto China, a few weeks ago, we presented two vehicles that will
  reinforce this trend:

the all-new fully-electric MINI Aceman* and an update to the electric
  BMW i4*.

The BMW i4 comes straight from the heart of the BMW brand and is a
  success story in its own right. People love its combination of
  e-drive, design and signature driving dynamics – all the things they
  associate with the BMW brand.

More than 80,000 customers bought a BMW i4 last year – making it one
  of the best-selling BEVs in the entire premium segment.

MINI is also continuing on a path that is just as brand-authentic and modern.

The “New MINI Family” is a real game changer that reimagines the
  brand's unique British heritage in an entirely new way for the future.

The all-electric MINI Aceman brings fresh impulses. With this latest
  addition, the New MINI Family now features three models that serve
  different segments and appeal to new customer groups.

This will enable us to continue and expand the MINI success story in
  our global markets.

Our growth and economic success today are laying a solid foundation
  for the future.

We are investing more than ever in developing new products, efficient
  technologies and automated driving functions, as well as in digitalisation.

As the biggest single investment in the history of the company, the
  NEUE KLASSE shows how we are redefining the BMW brand for the future.

From design, to drive trains, to totally
  new forms of digital interaction between human and machine – the NEUE
  KLASSE represents a massive leap into the future across virtually all
  fields of technology.

All future BMW models will benefit from this – regardless of their
  drive technology. In this way, we are able to ensure that our
  customers always have the latest technology on board.

The NEUE KLASSE will start out with a Sports Activity Vehicle and a
  sedan in the current 3 Series segment.

We provided a glimpse of what this future will look like for BMW at
  our Annual Conference.

The BMW Vision Neue Klasse and the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X showcase
  both the consistency and the breadth of the NEUE KLASSE.

There
  is plenty of room between the two vehicles for innovation and new
  models – and we intend to use it.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The BMW Group is growing – despite the many different challenges we
  face. Even in times of change, we deliver positive financial results
  at a consistently high level.

The course we are charting today will enable us to build on this
  success in the future – across all our brands and products, with
  next-generation technologies and within the company.

We are in a strong position globally and maintaining our leadership
  of the global premium segment.

We recognise that there are a lot of new players looking to gain a
  foothold in this highly attractive segment – and, of course, we are
  taking this very seriously.

But this is not a one-way street. You can be sure of that: Every
  player in this industry, whether an ambitious newcomer or an
  established manufacturer, is also keeping a very close eye on the BMW Group.
