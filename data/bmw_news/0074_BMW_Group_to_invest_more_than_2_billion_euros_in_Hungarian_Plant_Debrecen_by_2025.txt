+++ In addition to vehicle production, BMW Group builds high-voltage
  battery assembly at Plant Debrecen +++ More than 500 additional jobs
  to be created by 2025 +++ Production of NEUE KLASSE starts here +++

TheBMW Group is building a
  high-voltage battery assembly for the vehicles of the NEUE KLASSE at
  its site in Hungary. The battery assembly will be located on the site
  of the Debrecen vehicle plant, which started construction about six
  months ago. The company will create more than 500 additional jobs and
  invest over two billion euros in the construction and launch of the
  entire plant by the end of 2025.

Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,
  Production, said: “In Debrecen, we are building the most advanced
  plant in the world. With our iFACTORY, we are setting new industry
  standards for vehicle production. Our investments underline our
  systematic approach to implementing e-mobility.”

The new announcements were also welcomed by the Hungarian government.
  Péter Szijjártó, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary,
  said: “The BMW Group plant in Debrecen is a symbol of the successful
  Hungarian economic policy of the past twelve years. The plant combines
  environmental protection and competitiveness, and that is much more
  than we have originally planned.”

“We are currently recruiting new colleagues locally and from all over
  Hungary, so we can build the future of BMW Group Plant Debrecen
  together,” explains Hans-Peter Kemser, President and CEO of BMW
  Manufacturing Hungary Kft. The plant, together with local partners in
  education, will launch a dual education programme in autumn 2023 at
  its in-house Training Centre.

László Papp, the Mayor of Debrecen, emphasised the role of the BMW
  Group for the city: „With its investment in Debrecen, in addition to
  creating new jobs, the BMW Group makes a long-term commitment to the
  community of our city. We are building a thriving future together.”

The assembly of high-voltage batteries will be located on the site of
  the Debrecen vehicle plant. Markus Fallböhmer, Senior Vice President
  of Battery Production at the BMW Group, explains: “The BMW iFACTORY is
  also about ensuring short distances for logistics. The close link
  between battery assembly and vehicle production is part of our strategy.”

In Debrecen, the next-generation round battery cells will be
  assembled into a battery housing – a metal frame, which is later
  integrated into the underbody of the car. The official start of
  production for the sixth generation high-voltage batteries will be in
  2025 – in parallel with the start of vehicle production. All batteries
  for the vehicles from Plant Debrecen will be assembled on site. The
  new production facility will extend over an area of about 140,000 m².
  Construction work recently began.

The battery is decisive for the competitiveness of electric vehicles.
  With the next generation of batteries for the NEUE KLASSE, range will
  improve by up to 30 percent, and the charging speed will be up to 30
  percent faster.

The BMW Group is particularly focused on keeping the carbon footprint
  and consumption of resources for production as low as possible,
  starting in the supply chain. Cell manufacturers will use cobalt,
  lithium and nickel that include a percentage of secondary material,
  i.e. raw materials that are not newly mined, but already in the loop,
  in production of battery cells. Combined with the commitment to use
  only green power from renewable energies for production of battery
  cells, the BMW Group will reduce the carbon footprint of battery cell
  production by up to 60 percent.
