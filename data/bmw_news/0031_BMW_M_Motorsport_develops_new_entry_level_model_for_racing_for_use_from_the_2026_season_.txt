“Proximity to our customers is one of the maxims we pursue at
  BMW M Motorsport. From our point of view, this also includes offering
  a car for grassroots racing that teams and newcomers to racing can
  afford and that at the same time offers them BMW M Motorsport
  technology at the highest level. Accordingly, we are delighted to be
  able to announce a successor model to the BMW M235i Racing, BMW M240i
  Racing, and BMW M2 CS Racing at this point. Our engineers are already
  working intensively at this early stage of development to optimally
  prepare the car for customer use.”
