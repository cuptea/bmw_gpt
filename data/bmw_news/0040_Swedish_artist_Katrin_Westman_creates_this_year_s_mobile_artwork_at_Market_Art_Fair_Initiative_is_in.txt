For the second year in a row, electric
  BMW cars dressed in the work of a Nordic artist can be seen around
  Stockholm. During this year's Market Art Fair, 17-19 May, the BMW cars
  designed by Swedish artist Katrin Westman will be used to drive guests
  to and from the fair. The idea for the initiative comes from the
  global BMW Art Car project, where famous artists have been applying
  their artworks on cars since 1975. For the second time, a Nordic
  artist has been selected and given the freedom to express their art on
  the BMW cars that will be used as shuttle cars during the days of the exhibition.

"Combining art and mobility has always been a passion for BMW.
  The collaboration with Market Art Fair gives us a unique opportunity
  to support young Nordic artists while emphasising our commitment to
  art and culture", says Johanna Kriisa, CEO of BMW Sweden.

The
  artist behind this year's winning entry "Wetland" is Katrin
  Westman (GSA Gallery, SE), known for her sensual and abstract artwork
  inspired by the Baroque and revolving around a dramatic and rich
  colour palette.

The mobile artworks displaying Katrin's distinctive aesthetic will
  also be displayed outside Liljevalchs during the fair weekend.

"I believe that art can reach a wider audience through this kind
  of meeting. Industrial designers and artists work for different
  purposes, but both workcreatively. There are things to learn from each
  other, but only time will tell exactly what and where it will
  lead", says Katrin Westman.

Last year's winner was Swedish-ethnic artist Siiri Jüris (Galleri
  Duerr, SW), but the idea of having Nordic artists' work adorn BMW cars
  comes from the BMW Art Car project, which has been running since 1975.

"BMW has a long history of global cultural engagement. To be
  able to collaborate with such a natural partner and together promote a
  young artist and bring the art into the city in the form of mobile
  artworks feels fantastic", says Petra Stenvall-Thompson
  Partnership Manager Market Art Fair.

For almost 50 years,
  BMW has allowed world-renowned artists to express their art using the
  car as a canvas. The idea of collaborating with prominent artists to
  transform cars into rolling works of art began when, in 1975, French
  racing driver Hevré Poulain came up with the idea of letting an
  artist, Alexander Calder, use the racing car as a canvas to paint a
  piece of art. No one could have predicted then that they were making
  modern art history and that the car would be the start of the BMW Art
  Car project.

Many world-famous artists have followed in Calder's footsteps,
  including , Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, David Hockney, Jenny
  Holzer, Cao Fei, Esther Mahlangu and Jeff Koons to name but a few.
  This spring, the car of the twentieth artist, Julie Mehretu, will
  compete at the 2024 Le Mans 24-hour race. Known for her abstract
  paintings, Mehretu is considered one of the most influential artists
  of her generation.
