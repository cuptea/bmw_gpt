Davis Bryant had a sensational day at the BMW
  International Open. The American, who is playing his first season on
  the DP World Tour, started on the 10th hole, made a birdie on the
  11

, and then aced the 12th hole (Par 3, 166 yards). He
  would go on to make eight more birdies, finishing the second round at
  12 under par to take the lead. On an otherwise perfect day, the
  25-year-old might only regret making his ace on the “wrong” hole. This
  year’s hole-in-one prize – a BMW M5 Touring – is awarded for an ace on
  the 17

hole, which remains in play over the weekend.

Closest behind Bryant are Kristoffer Reitan (NOR, -10), along with
  Yuto Katsuragawa (JPN), Daniel Brown (ENG), and Jordan Smith (ENG),
  all at -9. “I honestly don’t know what happened today. The hole-in-one
  really got things going – that’s always incredibly cool,” said Bryant.
  “I’m just very proud of how I executed everything, stuck to my
  process, and holed some key putts. That was a big factor. The spark
  really lit today – and then you just ride that momentum.”

Bryant’s ace – contributing to making him the first American since
  John Daly (2001) who could potentially win the BMW International Open
  – was one of 28 eagles recorded on Friday. For every eagle made during
  the tournament rounds, the BMW Group is donating €1,000 to the Philipp
  Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The joint initiative aims to
  equip children and youth with key life skills in movement, nutrition,
  and personal development. Heading into the weekend, the donation total
  already stands at €44,000.

While Bryant and Reitan have created a slight gap, the leaderboard
  remains tightly packed, promising an exciting weekend of golf. A total
  of 68 players made the cut – including seven Germans. Among the most
  promising are Marcel Siem (-7, T10), Marcel Schneider, Matti Schmid,
  and the sensationally performing amateur Tim Wiedemeyer (all -6, T15).

Siem said: “I’m very happy. Apart from the 9th hole, I took advantage
  of all the chances I had. All in all, I’m really satisfied with my
  6-under round today. I don’t think much more was possible – I really
  got the maximum out of it. My goal is to start the weekend confidently
  and go at the flags more aggressively when I’m in the fairway. That’s
  my game plan.”

Schneider was also pleased with his performance: “Today went better
  than yesterday. The putter got really hot at times. Overall, the
  ball-striking was better. It wasn’t perfect yet, but overall, I’m
  satisfied. The four early birdies definitely gave me a push. My plan
  is to keep playing well, attack the course, and hit a lot of greens.
  I’ll take it shot by shot and see where that gets me.”

Amateur Tim Wiedemeyer has been playing impressive golf this week. In
  his hometown, the 20-year-old followed up his even-par opening round
  with a 66 today and said: “I’m very happy. Six under par is pretty
  good. I tried to hit a lot of fairways and greens. And when the putter
  gets hot, you shoot a good score. The support – especially on the back
  nine – was really cool. It felt more like an evening round with
  friends. That definitely helped my game today. Now, I just want to
  have fun. The cut is made – let’s see what happens and enjoy it.”

For Martin Kaymer (-4, T37), the dream of a second win in Munich
  after 2008 is still alive – albeit with a steep task ahead, sitting
  seven shots behind the leader. The two-time Major champion said:
  “Overall, I was satisfied with my game and hit a lot of good shots,
  but I didn’t take advantage of the par-5s. Those are the real birdie
  chances this week, and I missed out there. On this course – especially
  if the weather is good – you can really go low. Marcel proved that
  today. I know what I need to do tomorrow and hope to shoot a good
  round to still be in contention on Sunday.”

Completing the group of Germans playing on the weekend are Yannik
  Paul (-4, T37) and Hurly Long (-3, T53). Missing the cut (-3) were
  defending champion Ewen Ferguson (SCO), Masters champion Patrick Reed
  (USA), and Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald (ENG).
