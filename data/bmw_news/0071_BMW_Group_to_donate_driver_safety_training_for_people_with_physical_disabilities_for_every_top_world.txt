  Championships in Oberhof worth twice as much +++ BMW M Driving

DSV Biathlon and BMW are taking the
  home World Championships as an opportunity to work together to give
  something back to society beyond sport. BMW has been linked with the
  discipline as a partner of the “International Biathlon Union” (IBU)
  since 2010, and as of this season has also been supporting Germany’s
  national biathlon team with electrified cars, as the mobility partner.
  For every top-six finish achieved by German athletes in Oberhof, BMW
  will donate a driver safety training course for people with physical
  disabilities. Three of these training courses will be gifted for every
  German World Championship medal.

“As a premium automobile manufacturer and the mobility partner of
  Germany’s national biathlon team, personal mobility is central for
  BMW. This is not a matter of course for all people. Joining forces
  with the DSV at the BMW IBU World Championships Biathlon, we want to
  do something about this,” said Stefan Teuchert, Head of BMW Group
  Germany. “The BMW M Driving Experience offering includes special
  safety training for persons with physical restrictions and supports
  them in having more autonomous and safer mobility on the road. BMW
  will make these training courses available to people in DSV skiing
  clubs, thereby expanding the mobility partnership beyond
  high-performance sport.”

Various BMW and BMW M models that have been equipped with control
  units operated by hand are used during the driver safety training
  courses. Participants learn how to keep their vehicle under control
  calmly and skilfully in unexpected situations. The offering is aimed
  at both paraplegics and people who work with people with physical
  challenges. Both groups can attend the special training course
  together and discover how to handle this kind of car safely.

“Our entire team is really looking forward to the home world
  championships, and to spectators being allowed at the track again. The
  athletes will give it their all to ensure German fans enjoy as many
  successful moments as possible,” said Walter Vogel, Managing Director
  of DSV Marketing GmbH. “Having worked with BMW to think about how to
  evolve our mobility partnership, and adding this inclusive approach to
  the home world championships, gives everyone an extra motivational
  boost for the races in Oberhof.”

The DSV will pass on all the driver training courses won by the
  German team at the BMW IBU World Championships Biathlon 2023 to its
  skiing clubs.

  attract and retain the best talent, and to meet customer expectations
