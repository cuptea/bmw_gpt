At the beginning of the year, the BMW Group
  is once again updating the software in its vehicles with BMW iDrive
  Operating System 7 and 8. At present, a about 4.7 million BMW vehicles
  are upgradeable thanks to their hardware and BMW iDrive Operating
  System. Since 2019, BMW has been offering free remote software
  upgrades several times a year for infotainment, driving, driver
  assistance, comfort and safety.

A recent
  update to BMW Digital Vehicle Access allows users to share the BMW
  Digital Key for their vehicle between Apple iPhones and Android
  smartphones for the first time. Shared BMW Digital Keys are also
  easier to activate in the vehicle. With the BMW software upgrade, a
  BMW Digital Key shared via smartphone can be activated directly in the
  vehicle by entering an activation code. Previously, a conventional
  vehicle key had to be located in the passenger compartment.

As a further innovation,
  the upcoming Remote Software Upgrade will introduce the Remote Control
  Parking function for certain countries and vehicles. It allows
  customers to perform remote-controlled parking manoeuvres outside the
  vehicle using the My BMW App – such as manoeuvres previously recorded
  in the vehicle with the Manoeuvring Assistant. Customers can also park
  their vehicle forwards or backwards within a radius of six metres,
  both lengthways and crossways.

The BMW Remote Software Upgrade enables customers
  of the mobile network operator AT&T in the USA to use the Personal
  eSIM. The Personal eSIM integrates BMW vehicles with Operating System
  8 into the customer's existing mobile phone contract and enables the
  vehicle for the 5G cellular standard. This allows customers to make
  phone calls without their smartphone in the vehicle, stream data via
  the Wi-Fi hotspot and use video-services directly in the vehicle.

The Remote Software Upgrade is currently
  available for more than 30 BMW models and therefore almost all BMW
  models with BMW Operating System 7 and 8. Customers can see the
  software status in the settings menu of their vehicle under Remote
  Software Upgrade and can search for available upgrades. Only the next
  possible upgrade is ever offered for installation, the user can never
  install the wrong version.

The availability of upgrades, services and functions depends on
  the vehicle model and equipment as well as the installed software
  version in the respective country. The country pages of the

provide
  information on the content and requirements for the Remote Software
  Upgrade that apply in the respective market.  Instructions and tips on
  Remote Software Upgrade can be found in the corresponding
