In an exclusive edition of only
  99 automobiles, a strictly limited number of the M850i xDrive Gran
  Coupé were created by Jeff Koons and BMW during several years of close
  collaboration. With THE 8 X JEFF KOONS, the most elaborately designed
  vehicle in all of BMW's history will be presented to a global audience
  for the first time on the occasion of Frieze Los Angeles. BMW is a
  long-term partner of the art fair; Jeff Koons is represented globally,
  and at Frieze Los Angeles, by Pace Gallery.

: “My edition of the BMW 8 Series
  is my dream car! It is very special to me and I’ve wanted to create a
  special edition BMW for a long time. It is sporty and flashy as well
  as minimalist and conceptual. I can’t wait to drive it and ride in it,
  and I hope that people will enjoy the Gran Coupé just as much as I do.
  On the car, the lines are getting bigger on their journey from the
  hood towards the trunk, creating a sense of forward movement just as
  the ‘POP!’ and the vapor thrust design elements do. The blue color
  resembles the vastness of space and I like the idea of the car being a
  global car. What matters is how we relate to each other and our
  awareness of everything we are surrounded by. For the driver and all
  passengers, there is a heightened state of pleasure. This is what my
  car has to offer.”

: “BMW thrives on constantly seeking out new challenges!
  Working with Jeff Koons again has inspired us all – throughout
  headquarters and across our plants in Germany. Never before in the
  history of our company has a BMW been created with such an extensive
  design effort as THE 8 X JEFF KOONS. A 'rolling sculpture' that will
  not only be displayed as a coveted collector's item in museums but
  will also be allowed to flourish on the road as a genuine BMW.”

The expressive and striking design combines eleven
  different exterior colors ranging from blue to silver as well as from
  yellow to black. Only four cars will be painted each week. The
  multi-colored interior is comprised of high-end materials, fine
  leather and a cupholder lid with an edition badging and the artist’s
  signature. The seats are made up of the striking red and blue which
  reflects the colors of superheroes from the comic book universe as
  well as those of the company’s high-performance unit BMW M. Overall,
  the energetic and powerful design includes both elements of pop art as
  well as geometric patterns paying homage to the sporty 8 Series Gran
  Coupe’s intricate contours and shape. The exploding lines of color at
  the rear, in turn, are their own unmediated homage to the artist's
  2010 BMW Art Car, while the "POP!" on each side as well as
  the vapor thrust imagery symbolize the power and speed of THE 8 X JEFF
  KOONS, according to the artist.

Over 200 hours of manual work were spent by highly specialized
  professionals at the BMW Group plants in Dingolfing and Landshut on
  the exterior paintwork alone, where the color samples were often
  applied with magnifying glasses. "Energetic,"
  "tantalizing," and "strong" is how international
  media described the car, following the publication of first design
  studies on the occasion of the cooperation’s announcement in early
  September 2021 at Munich's Pinakothek der Moderne museum. "Dozens
  of engineers and designers have given their all to celebrate our
  partnership and make his vision come true," said Oliver Zipse.
  The artist himself spent many days on site at the Dingolfing plant
  over a period of numerous months discussing design options with the
  BMW employees involved. “I was thinking very intensely about it: What
  is the essence of the 8 Series Gran Coupé? What is the essence of
  power? How to create something that exemplifies all the energy of the
  BMW 8 Series that is also able to touch upon the human element?”

Each vehicle comes with a large-format certificate
  signed by Jeff Koons, which in addition to Oliver Zipse's signature
  also contains the individual Vehicle Identification Number of the
  respective vehicle. The artist also designed the dust jacket of the
  Driver's Manual. One further signature of the artist is let into the
  cupholder panel. Koons deliberately chose the Bavarian blue from the
  BMW logo.

The original BMW 850i was the first model of the 8 Series launched in
  1990 and was celebrated as creating a new perspective of progress in
  advanced motoring, appealing to the connoisseur who acknowledges
  elegance and performance as the ultimate blend of perfection. THE 8 X
  JEFF KOONS also continues this tradition.

In
  2010, the American artist already created a unique BMW M3 GT2 Art Car
  which performed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and was unveiled at
  the Centre Pompidou in Paris. That same year, the rock singer Bono
  from U2 wrote in an editorial for the New York Times that Jeff Koons
  should have a part in designing the car of the future. BMW and Koons
  continued the conversation and in early 2020 decided on a limited
  edition of the new BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé, which had its world
  premiere in January 2022.

Initially, THE 8 X JEFF KOONS will be on display for the general
  public in Manhattan's Rockefeller Plaza before one vehicle from the
  edition, signed on the tailgate by Jeff Koons,  will be auctioned off
  at Christie's in New York on April 4. All proceeds from the highest
  bid will go to the International Centre for Missing & Exploited
  Children (ICMEC). Jeff Koons has been personally involved with this
  nonprofit NGO for over two decades.

Following its world premiere, THE 8 X JEFF KOONS will be presented at
  numerous art fairs and events in Europe, Asia and the Middle East,
  including the 16th Istanbul Contemporary, Paris Photo, the Goodwood
  Festival of Speed, Art Dubai, West Bund Art & Design Fair Shanghai
  and Art Basel Hong Kong.

Initiated by French
  race car driver and art aficionado Hervé Poulain and conceived in
  collaboration with the founder of BMW Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, the
  first BMW Art Car was commissioned when both asked Alexander Calder to
  design Poulain’s BMW race car in 1975. Since then, 19 artists from
  throughout the world have created BMW automobiles of their time. The
  BMW Art Cars by Roy Lichtenstein, Esther Mahlangu, Jenny Holzer, Andy
  Warhol, David Hockney, Ólafur Elíasson, Frank Stella, Robert
  Rauschenberg, Cao Fei and John Baldessari, among others, are all
  inspired by developments in art, design and technology. Jeff Koons
  designed the 17th BMW Art Car in 2010, the BMW M3 GT2, which also
  competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. On the occasion of 50 years of
  BMW Group Cultural Engagement last year, the Art Cars entered the
  digital realm and are presented in augmented reality since then. Via
  the free Acute Art app, the digital rolling sculptures are accessible
  to everyone around the world at any time.
