Sporty elegance, groundbreaking technology
  and luxurious space at the rear are combined in the model variants of
  the new

and the new BMW i5 which have been
  specially developed for the Chinese automotive market. Adapted in
  numerous details to the specific requirements of Chinese target
  groups, the versions of the new business sedan feature a 12 centimeter
  extended wheelbase and distinctive proportions. This results in
  particularly generous space and comfort in the rear, which is further
  enhanced by exclusive equipment features.

For the first time, the BMW 5 Series Sedan for China will be offered
  not just with highly efficient combustion engines but also with an
  all-electric model in the form of the BMW i5. The car’s progressive
  character is also reflected in the further developed BMW iDrive
  featuring “QuickSelect”: with its BMW

and
  China-specific digital services, this enables an innovative form of
  interaction between human being and automobile.

The new

and the new

for China are
  based on the eighth generation of the world’s most successful business
  sedan. More than 10 million BMW 5 Series vehicles have been produced
  since 1972. The BMW 5 Series continues to grow in popularity in China
  too, with some 530,000 vehicles of the series having been delivered to
  Chinese customers from 2020 to 2022 alone. This makes the BMW 5 Series
  Sedan the market leader in the premium upper mid-range vehicle
  segment. A total of around two million units have been sold since the
  start of local production in China.

The fourth generation of model variants specially developed for China
  is being launched in the form of the new BMW 5 Series Sedan and the
  new BMW i5. The new models will be produced exclusively for the
  Chinese market at the Dadong plant operated in Shenyang by the joint
  venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.

Right from the outset, the new BMW 5 Series Sedan and the new BMW i5
  for China have been designed with a clear focus on the needs of
  Chinese target groups. Its exterior design combines signature brand
  features with innovative elements, ensuring it is oriented towards the
  stylistic preferences of a young generation of customers in China who
  value inspiring charisma and individual flair. A characteristic
  combination of dynamic performance and elegance gives the new models a
  distinctive and emotional appearance.

The upright front section of the new BMW 5 Series Sedan and the new
  BMW i5 for China signals a self-confident presence. It features a
  modern interpretation of BMW’s hallmark twin headlights and a BMW
  radiator grille that extends far forward with striking contour
  lighting. The side view is dominated by clear-cut, amply designed
  surfaces. Distinctive proportions are ensured by a roofline that
  slopes gently to the rear combined and a wheelbase that is extended
  compared to other variants of the new business sedan available
  worldwide. At the powerful rear of the new models slim LED lights
  divided by a chrome strip add a powerfully expressive accentuation.

An innovative lighting design likewise contributes to the inspiring
  appearance of the new models. The interior lighting, the LED
  headlights, the contour lighting of the BMW radiator grille and the
  light carpet in the entrance area create a carefully coordinated,
  five-stage welcome and goodbye scenario. One exclusive detail of the
  models designed for the Chinese market is the number “5"
  illuminated as standard in the area of the Hofmeister kink on the
  C-pillar. On the new BMW i5 its blue light pulsates discreetly and at
  a low frequency while the high-voltage battery is charging. With other
  engines the number lights up in white.

The interior of the new BMW 5 Series Sedan and the new BMW i5 for
  China is both modern and luxurious due to design features and
  technological innovations that were first presented in the new BMW 7
  Series and the BMW iX. With the BMW Curved Display, the redesigned
  steering wheel, the BMW Interaction Bar and the further developed BMW
  iDrive with “QuickSelect”, intelligent interaction between human being
  and automobile is raised to a unique level in the BMW 5 Series
  segment. With Crafted Clarity glass applications for selected controls
  and a Titanium Bronze inlay for the passenger side instrument panel,
  the cockpit acquires an exclusive flair that is specifically oriented
  towards Chinese styling.

The ride experience at the rear is characterised by generous legroom
  and exclusive details. Another comfort feature adopted directly from
  the luxury sedans of the BMW 7 Series is the BMW Theatre Screen: with
  its 31.3-inch panoramic display, 8K resolution and 5G connectivity, it
  enables a high-quality video streaming experience during travel. In
  combination with the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound
  System, the BMW Theatre Screen transforms the rear of the new BMW 5
  Series Sedan and the new BMW i5 into a private cinema on wheels. Other
  features include 4-zone automatic climate control, a model logo
  embossed into the headrests, and seat surfaces with exclusive quilting
  and bicolour design.
