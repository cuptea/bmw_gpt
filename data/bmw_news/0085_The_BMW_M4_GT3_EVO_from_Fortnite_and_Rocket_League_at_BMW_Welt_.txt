This new BMW Welt exhibit is making a vehicle
  from the popular video game series Fortnite and Rocket League a
  reality. Not only is the BMW M4 GT3 EVO the latest addition to the
  vehicle catalogue of the multi-player online games, but its design is
  also in the style of the well-known TV anime “BLEACH”. The car will be
  displayed at BMW Welt from 20

December to 11

January for unforgettable photo opportunities.

BMW introduced the world’s first car creator in Fortnite back in 2023
  with the “Hypnopolis” creative island, where players could design the
  new BMW iX2* according to their individual preferences. Before that,
  the BMW M240i*, the BMW 1 Series, and the first-generation BMW M3*
  made their debut in Rocket League.

The design of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO is in the style of the iconic
  costume of the main character of “BLEACH”, Ichigo Kurosaki. Alongside
  the launch of the racing car design, a PUMA sneaker model from the BMW
  M Motorsport collection in the style of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO is also
  available in the Fortnite Shop.

Sandra Wittemer, Head of BMW Welt, said: “With this very special BMW
  M4 GT3 EVO, we are bringing the fascination of motorsport, digital pop
  culture, and design together in a unique way. The livery inspired by
  ‘Bleach’ shows just how creatively and diversely BMW M can be
  interpreted. It’s fascinating to see that this car is not just making
  an impression in virtual worlds such as Fortnite and Rocket League but
  will now also be a very real experience for BMW Welt visitors.”

BMW Welt is closed annually between 24

and
  26

December, as well as on 31

December and
  1

January.
