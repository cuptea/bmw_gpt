After a disappointing qualifying session for all BMW M Motorsport
  teams, the day initially didn’t seem destined for celebration.
  However, over the course of the three-hour race, all crews made
  significant progress. The #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO started from 31st
  position after a penalty, but Weerts, van der Linde, and Ugo de Wilde
  (BEL) fought their way up to sixth place, earning enough points to
  crown van der Linde and Weerts as the new overall champions in the
  combined Sprint and Endurance Cup standings. The duo had also secured
  the Sprint Cup title just a few weeks earlier. Over the 2025 season,
  the #32 car achieved three victories and four additional podium
  finishes, which also secured the overall team title for Team WRT.

Another title for Team WRT was clinched by Jens Klingmann (GER), Al
  Faisal Al Zubair (OMA), and Ben Tuck (GBR) with an impressive
  second-place finish in the race. The overall podium for the #777 BMW
  M4 GT3 EVO of AlManar Racing by WRT also secured the team title in the
  GOLD Cup. Third place on the podium in Barcelona went to Augusto
  Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) in the
  #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of ROWE Racing.

Despite a challenging race that included an early, unavoidable spin,
  Jarrod Waberski (RSA), Mex Jansen (NED), and William Moore (GBR) still
  had reason to celebrate as the trio won the drivers' title in the
  SILVER category of the Endurance Cup with the #42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of
  Century Motorsport.

"What a
  season finale in the GT World Challenge Europe! Congratulations to
  Kelvin van der Linde, Charles Weerts, and Team WRT on winning the
  overall titles. This triumph highlights the impressive consistency of
  the team and drivers in both Sprint and Endurance races, which present
  completely different challenges. To crown this strong season with such
  a spectacular comeback of 25 positions today is fantastic. My
  heartfelt congratulations also go to the champions in the GOLD and
  SILVER Cups. AlManar Racing by WRT and Century Motorsport delivered
  outstanding performances throughout the season and represented BMW M
  Motorsport more than worthily in this highly competitive racing
  series. Looking at the race itself, congratulations to AlManar Racing
  by WRT and ROWE Racing for their podium finishes after equally
  impressive comebacks. A big thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport
  and to the teams who contributed to this extremely successful GT World
  Challenge Europe season!"

"I’m
  incredibly happy that we were able to finish the season like this.
  Winning the overall titles was the big goal after the Sprint Cup
  titles. It didn’t look like it after qualifying, but huge thanks to
  the team for the spot-on strategic call in the first stint, which
  brought us forward. Congratulations to the #777 crew for their podium
  and the team title in the GOLD Cup. I want to sincerely thank everyone
  in the team whose hard work made such a successful season possible."

"It has been a fantastic season, crowned with the
  overall championship. Of course, our race pace today wasn’t
  particularly strong. We need to learn from this during the break to
  improve for next year. But looking at the entire season, we were
  probably the most consistent team – and that’s the reward. I’m very
  proud of the entire Team WRT, Charles, and Ugo. It’s the perfect
  conclusion to my first GT World Challenge season with BMW M
  Motorsport. I’m very proud."

"It was a very good season. Sprint Cup winners and
  overall champions – that’s everything we could have wished for at the
  start of the year. We made almost no mistakes and got the best out of
  every situation. The only regret is Spa, as it’s the biggest race, and
  we could have put ourselves in an even better position for the
  Endurance Cup there. But overall, we can be very proud of the season.
  A big thank you to BMW M Motorsport for providing us with an
  incredibly strong car. Thanks also to Team WRT, Kelvin, and Ugo for a
  great season we shared together."

"What an incredible race! At the start of
  the weekend, we didn’t feel like we had the fastest car, so we focused
  on long-run performance with the setup. During the race, a brilliant
  strategic decision in the first stint moved us far forward, and Ben
  was even able to work his way almost to the front. For me, it got
  tight at the end due to the late safety car, but I’m super happy with
  second place and winning the team title in the GOLD Cup. Once again,
  we’ve shown what can be achieved through perfect teamwork."

"We had a strong final race. At the start, we
  had some luck with the safety car and benefitted from a good strategy.
  I had a very good stint with some overtakes. Without the issue at Paul
  Ricard and the retirement in Monza, we could have been in the
  championship fight. Overall, though, we can be satisfied with our
  season – and we’ll try to come back even stronger next year."

"This season was
  spectacular. From the first race, we were able to score points
  consistently, won at Monza, and stood on the podium at the 24 Hours of
  Spa-Francorchamps. Here in Barcelona, after the spin in the first lap,
  we thought the title might slip away from us, but we stuck together as
  a team, fought back, and ultimately brought the title home. Many
  thanks to Century Motorsport and BMW M Motorsport for this amazing year."
