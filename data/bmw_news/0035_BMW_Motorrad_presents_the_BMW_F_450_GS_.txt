The new BMW F 450 GS marks the next step in the
  GS model family, specifically addressing the 48 hp A2 class with
  proven GS technology and iconic design.

At the EICMA international motorcycle show, BMW Motorrad gave a
  preview of a fully-fledged GS model already in 2024, which
  specifically addresses the steadily growing market segment of
  medium-sized displacement motorcycles.

The series version of the BMW F 450 GS consistently lives up to this
  claim: It is a versatile all-rounder that combines everyday usability,
  sporty dynamic performance, touring comfort, and off-road
  capabilities. In the "GS Trophy" equipment variant, it
  follows in the footsteps of the concept vehicle. It adopts its
  striking design language and high-quality, high-tech components,
  including magnesium parts for maximum performance and low weight.

With its balanced power-to-torque ratio, low weight, and
  characteristic GS ergonomics, the F 450 GS provides riding fun and
  confidence from the first meter. The new F 450 GS thus combines the
  classic GS spirit with a modern, accessible, and simultaneously
  powerful approach.

"With the BMW F 450 GS, we are addressing a particularly broad
  target audience. This motorcycle is aimed at anyone who values
  ​​maximum agility, versatility, pure riding pleasure, and cutting-edge
  technology – regardless of whether they are on the road every day, on
  long tours, or simply looking for a light, dynamic, and uncomplicated
  bike. The current trend toward downsizing, i.e., switching from heavy
  motorcycles to compact and versatile machines, demonstrates the great
  interest in this segment. The F 450 GS offers the ideal combination of
  playful handling, maneuverability, riding dynamics, and high-quality
  equipment – ​​without compromising on quality or technical
    performance.”

Astrid Neudecker, Product Manager BMW
  F 450 GS

The BMW Easy Ride Clutch (ERC) is a technical highlight and a further
  development of a centrifugal clutch. This system eliminates the need
  to manually operate the clutch lever while riding. This applies to all
  situations, from starting off and changing gears to demanding off-road
  maneuvers. BMW Motorrad is setting a new standard in this vehicle class.

A range of attractive options will be added at the time of market
  launch: The F 450 GS can be equipped with an Akrapovic end muffler and
  original BMW Motorrad cross-spoke wheels on request. The result is a
  package that combines sporty dynamic performance, technical innovation
  and GS DNA perfectly.

The completely redesigned BMW F 450 GS is a
  sporty adventure bike that complements the current BMW Motorrad model
  portfolio, with developers focusing on excellent handling
  characteristics, strong performance, durability, and optimum accessibility.

The design focuses on the consistent implementation of the current GS
  design language. With iconic features such as the LED headlight with
  "X" daytime riding light and the distinctive flyline, the
  bike's affiliation with the BMW Motorrad GS family is clear at first glance.

At the heart of the new BMW F 450 GS is a
  completely newly developed two-cylinder in-line engine with fuel
  injection and a stainless steel exhaust system on the right-hand side.
  The new F 450 GS impresses with its powerful performance and pulling
  power, delivering a power output of 35 kW (48 hp) at 8,750 rpm and a
  maximum torque of 43 Nm at

6,750 rpm.

Thanks to
  the use of high-tech materials and optimized internal friction, these
  performance values are achieved with exactly 420 cm³. This makes the
  engine one of the most compact and powerful in the A2 two-cylinder
  segment. It not only meets the strict EU5+ requirements but is also
  particularly economical, consuming just 3.8 liters per 100 km. A range
  of over 350 km can be achieved in conjunction with the 14-liter tank.
  The maintenance interval is the standard 10,000 km for BMW motorcycles.

Unique on the motorcycle market, the engine features a crankshaft
  with crankpins offset by 135 degrees and, in conjunction with a single
  balance shaft, sets a technical exclamation mark: this design ensures
  a characterful, emotional ride while simultaneously reducing unwanted
  vibrations to an exceptionally low level.

A
  technical highlight of the new BMW F 450 GS is the Easy Ride Clutch
  (ERC). Its core is a precision centrifugal unit in the clutch, which
  engages the clutch depending on engine speed.

This system is standard on the GS Trophy variant and available as an
  optional accessory for all other model variants. In combination with
  the Shift Assistant Pro, manual operation of the clutch lever is
  completely eliminated – from starting off and gear changes to
  demanding maneuvers.

The clutch lever, however, remains intact and allows the rider to
  intervene manually at any time if necessary – for example, to lift the
  front wheel over an obstacle or to improve control when descending on
  slippery surfaces.

Technologically, the ERC is based on an advanced centrifugal clutch.
  Unlike conventional systems, it remains closed during overrun. This
  creates natural, familiar, and predictable handling at all times –
  comparable to a conventional clutch. The engine brake remains fully
  active until just before a stop; only when the idle speed is reached
  does the ERC automatically open, reliably preventing the engine from stalling.

The system ensures greater dynamics, control, and comfort – whether
  maneuvering, in city traffic, on winding roads, or off-road.

The likewise newly designed
  six-speed transmission transmits torque to the left-hand secondary
  drive via an X-ring chain.

For fast upshifts and downshifts
  without clutch operation, the new F 450 GS is offered with Shift
  Assistant Pro in all equipment variants except the basic variant. This
  can be retrofitted to the basic version.

The BMW F 450 GS offers three riding modes as
  standard: "Rain", "Road" and "Enduro",
  allowing the motorcycle to be adapted to suit individual preferences.
  Standard equipment also includes ABS Pro, Dynamic Brake Control (DBC),
  Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) and engine drag torque control (MSR).

The additional “Enduro Pro” mode, which is used from the Exclusive
  equipment variant onwards, is designed for off-road use with
  coarse-tread off-road tires and allows the ABS on the rear wheel to be deactivated.

The new BMW F
  450 GS also features a completely new chassis concept. Playful
  handling, optimum accessibility, high riding precision and riding
  stability were the developers' top priorities. The specially developed
  lattice-tube frame of the

BMW F 450 GS consists of
  welded steel tubes and forged parts. The frame integrates the
  two-cylinder in-line engine as a supporting element and is designed to
  be lightweight yet robust.

Front wheel control
  is provided by a torsionally rigid KYB upside-down telescopic fork
  with a 43 mm inner tube diameter. The Sport and GS Trophy variants
  feature the so-called "sports suspension." The fork is
  adjustable for rebound and compression damping. Rear wheel control is
  provided by a closed, and therefore extremely torsionally rigid, yet
  lightweight, hollow-cast aluminum double-sided swing arm, coupled with
  a directly connected KYB central spring strut (adjustable spring
  preload and rebound damping) with travel-dependent damping derived
  from rally racing, a unique feature in this segment.

The new BMW F 450 GS
  features lightweight yet robust cast aluminum wheels. It is fitted
  with tubeless tires for road and off-road use, sized 100/90-19 at the
  front and

130/80-17 at the rear. Additionally, the
  Original BMW Motorrad Accessories range offers cross-spoke wheels.

The front wheel of the new BMW F 450 GS
  features a floating single-disc brake with a Brembo 4-piston fixed
  caliper and a 310 mm brake disc diameter for superior, stable
  deceleration. A single disc brake with 1-piston floating caliper and
  240 mm diameter is used on the rear wheel.

The new BMW F 450 GS already comes standard with BMW Motorrad ABS
  Pro. ABS Pro also offers increased safety when braking in curves by
  enabling ABS-assisted braking while leaning. Dynamic Brake Control
  (DBC) offers increased safety when braking, even in difficult
  situations, by preventing unintentional throttle application. The
  dynamic brake light effectively alerts following vehicles to the
  braking motorcycle ahead.

A
  sophisticated ergonomic triangle and a high, close-to-the-body
  handlebar made of tapered aluminum tubing ensure an ideal riding
  position in all conditions. The body and the 14-liter fuel tank below
  it are designed for optimal support and good knee contact, both when
  seated and while standing off-road. A wide range of accessories are
  available to meet the individual needs of riders, including a
  handlebar riser, a rally seat, and the option of a low seat.

The new BMW F 450 GS comes
  with a two-part seat (845 mm) as standard. The low Black rider's seat
  (830 mm) and the high Rallye seat in Black/White/Red (865 mm),
  available as part of the Original BMW Motorrad Accessories, can be
  adapted to individual requirements. The standard adjustable handlebar
  levers and the optional 20 mm handlebar risers made of high-strength
  anodized silver aluminum offer further adjustment options.

The new BMW F 450 GS comes standard with a footrest system with
  removable rubber grips, whose serrated profile makes it suitable for
  off-road use. A very practical feature is the easy height adjustment
  of the foot brake lever by 20 mm in two positions to suit individual
  needs for on- and off-road riding. The gearshift lever is also height-adjustable.

Wider enduro footrests are included starting with the Exclusive
  version or are available as optional accessories.

The modular design of the
  available windshields (optional accessories) allows for individual
  customization. Depending on the intended use and personal preference,
  you can choose between the high Tour windshield (height-adjustable)
  and the clear or tinted Rally windshield. This allows the comfort and
  wind and weather protection of the new BMW F 450 GS to be tailored
  specifically to individual needs.

In the event of a fall or tip-over, Original BMW Motorrad Accessories
  offer effective ways to protect your motorcycle from damage, including
  engine guards, engine protection bars, front axle protectors, and
  other protective components.

The diverse range of special accessories – whether side bags, tail
  bags, luggage rolls, tank bags, luggage racks, or top cases – offers
  maximum flexibility for every application.

The new BMW F 450 GS
  features an LED headlight with an iconic "X" daytime riding
  light signature as standard. The turn indicator and control lamps of
  the F 450 GS also use LED technology.

A large 6.5-inch TFT display is also standard on the new BMW F 450
  GS. The variety of information, display quality, and, last but not
  least, user-friendliness are premium. It comes standard with screen
  displays tailored to the BMW GS world: the Pure Ride Screen and the
  Sport Screen with detailed information on DTC, braking force, and lean
  angle. Taking phone calls, listening to music, and navigation while
  riding is also possible.

The new BMW F 450 GS is available in
  four equipment variants: the

model in Cosmic Black and the

, also in Cosmic Black, with
  off-road footrests, handguards, a plastic underbody guard, Riding
  Modes Pro, Shift Assistant Pro, and a clear windshield.

Another equipment variant is the

  underbody protection, Riding Modes Pro, Shift Assistant Pro, a clear
  windshield, and the “sports suspension” (with KYB fork adjustable in
  rebound and compression). The fourth variant, the

in Racing Blue Metallic, tops the lineup. It features
  off-road footrests, white handguards, Riding Modes Pro, Shift
  Assistant Pro, “Sports Suspension”, a tinted rally windshield, an
  aluminum engine guard, and the new, enhanced version of centrifugal
  clutch: the Easy Ride Clutch (ERC).
