+++ Stage is set for the first ATP 500 event in Munich +++ The
  premiere winner in the new era can look forward to the all-electric

  socially disadvantaged youths with access to tennis and expand their
  future prospects +++

With one day to go before the first serve at
  the BMW Open by Bitpanda (April 12-20, 2025, MTCC Iphitos), further
  key details for the premiere of the iconic tournament as an ATP 500
  event were presented this Friday: the Winner's Car and the FUTURE ACES
  program initiated by the BMW Group.

Amidst the more than 6,000 spectator seats on the new temporary
  Center Court, the Winner's Car for the BMW Open by Bitpanda 2025 has
  also found its place. Christian Ach, Head of BMW Germany, and
  Tournament Director Patrik Kühnen unveiled the all-electric BMW iX M70
  (WLTP combined (EnVKV): Energy consumption 23.5 kWh/100km; CO2
  emissions 0 g/km; CO2 class A). This new technology flagship of the
  BMW Group is manufactured at the Dingolfing plant and thus has a “home
  game“ at the 109th International Tennis Championships of Bavaria,
  which has been held as the BMW Open since 1987.

“As with the BMW Open by Bitpanda, the BMW iX is a success story that
  has been significantly enhanced for the year 2025. The new BMW iX
  impresses with up to 25% higher drive power, significantly improved
  efficiency and a range of up to 701 kilometres in the WLTP cycle,“
  said Ach. “More performance, more sportiness, a more dynamic design
  than ever before– making it the perfect Winner's Car for the ATP 500 premiere.“

Starting this year, there will be additional winners at the BMW Open
  by Bitpanda, beyond the singles and doubles champions. This is ensured
  by the long-term programme FUTURE ACES, which aims to provide socially
  disadvantaged children and youths from Munich with access to tennis
  and open up expanded future prospects for them. For FUTURE ACES,
  partners of the BMW Open by Bitpanda have come together, initiated by
  the BMW Group, foremost among them MTTC Iphitos and organizer MMP.

“It is important for the BMW Group to make a relevant contribution to
  the common good and to actively shape social projects – especially in
  sports. We keep a firm focus on participation and equal opportunities
  because they are decisive factors for the prosperity and cohesion of
  our society,“ said Ach. “We are very pleased that FUTURE ACES – a
  programme that will work precisely in this direction – is now
  launching, and that our BMW Open partners are supporting it with great
  enthusiasm. This wonderful collaboration has made the growth of the
  tournament possible and will now hopefully also sustainably improve
  the future prospects of many young people.“

Every ace during the tournament results in a donated coaching session
  at MTTC Iphitos for children and youths with challenging starts. They
  get the opportunity to learn tennis, develop personally in a safe and
  supportive environment, make connections, and gain valuable
  experiences. They are accompanied by mentors from the partners, who
  act as motivators and provide guidance for their professional and
  personal future. This is complemented by offerings such as information
  days and internships in the club and BMW Open environment. Thus,
  participants receive various opportunities to discover their
  potentials and develop skills, thereby starting a self-determined life
  as FUTURE ACES.

Therefore, every ace in the singles and doubles competitions of the
  BMW Open by Bitpanda is doubly important. The field of world-class
  players, who will be responsible for as many aces as possible, is led
  by Olympic champion Alexander Zverev (GER), rising star Ben Shelton
  (USA), Felix Auger-Aliassime (CAN), and defending champion Jan-Lennard
  Struff (GER).

The remaining four starting places will be awarded
  in the qualification starting tomorrow, Saturday. The tournament then
  kicks off in full on Monday, with the final matches scheduled for
  Easter Sunday. All matches from the Center Court can be watched live
  and for free via the streaming app Joyn and ran.de. Additionally, both
  singles semifinals on Saturday and the singles final on Sunday will be
  broadcast live on ProSieben Maxx. As usual, Sky will broadcast all
  matches on pay-TV, and Eurosport will show the first match of the day
  live from Monday to Thursday.
