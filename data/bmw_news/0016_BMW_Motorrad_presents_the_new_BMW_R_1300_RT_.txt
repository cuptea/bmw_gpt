Harald Spagl, Project Manager BMW R 1300 RT

The new BMW R 1300 RT follows in the footsteps of its highly
  successful predecessor. It continues to build on the proven qualities
  of the BMW RT, such as touring capability and riding comfort - alone,
  as a pair or with plenty of luggage.

At the same time, the new R 1300 RT has broadened its usage profile
  by making its dynamic systems even more prominent. Sporty optional
  equipment such as the sport brake, the enhanced Shift Assistant Pro
  and the newly developed DCA electronic suspension allow an even more
  active and dynamic riding style. The range of optional extras is
  complemented by the Automated Shift Assistant ASA, which can be ridden
  in a sporty and dynamic manual mode, but also allows comfortable
  riding in automatic mode. All this, combined with a more dynamic and
  visually lighter design, promises to continue the success story of the
  BMW RT.

The wind and weather protection concept of the new R 1300 RT includes
  adjustable side trim that is homogeneously integrated into the design.
  This makes it possible to provide the rider with an adequate supply of
  fresh air at all times, even in challenging conditions such as city
  traffic or high outside temperatures on country roads, and to offer
  highly effective protection from the wind and weather at low
  temperatures when riding on the highway or motorway.

In addition to the basic version in Alpine White 3 uni colour, the
  new BMW R 1300 RT is available in the Triple Black model variant in
  Blackstorm metallic, the emphatically dynamic Impulse model variant in
  Racing Blue metallic and the particularly elegant model variant Option
  719 Camargue in Blue Ridge Mountain metallic.

The BMW R 1300 RT's design, engine and chassis are not the only
  aspects of the BMW touring icon that reflect the BMW Motorrad
  development team's ambition to expand the range of possible uses of
  the new BMW R 1300 RT and make it even more dynamic. Equal importance
  was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a more active
  riding position.

Accordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests
  and seat on the new R 1300 RT have been designed to position the rider
  noticeably further forward. This results in improved feedback from the
  front section and therefore even greater controllability during
  dynamic riding. At the same time, the more active seating position
  still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger.
  The height and angle of the rider's seat can be adjusted to fine-tune
  the riding position. Passenger comfort has also been significantly
  improved. The new cases now offer more space for the passenger’s lower
  legs without compromising the volume of the cases. The passenger seat
  has also been lengthened. There is now more space to change your
  seating position from time to time on longer trips.

As usual, BMW Motorrad's engineers have paid particular attention to
  easy access and a low seat height. For this reason, the development of
  the new R 1300 RT placed particular focus on achieving a seat height
  of only 780 mm. The inner leg curve is also significantly smaller than
  on the previous model. In addition to the standard seat, other seats
  are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.

The new BMW R 1300 RT is equipped as standard with cases (27 litres
  each) for touring and holiday trips. Further highlights of the new R
  1300 RT are the Vario cases, available ex works for the first time as
  an optional equipment for a BMW RT. The variable luggage system allows
  the volume to be adjusted from 27 to 33 litres to suit the width of
  the motorcycle. Both cases are electrified and can be unlocked using
  the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting,
  and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The two
  topcases with a capacity of 39 and 54 litres respectively offer
  additional storage space. The large 54-litre luggage compartment is
  also electric. A special feature is the heated backrest for the passenger.

The boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 RT has a capacity of exactly
  1,300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm
  (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from
  an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It
  has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still
  at 7,750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 ,00 rpm
    (predecessor:

143 Nm at 6,250 rpm), making it by
  far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its
  maximum engine speed is 9,000 rpm.

In standard trim, the new R 1300 RT has three riding modes for
  adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road”
  riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road
  conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the
  innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the
  maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request
  the new R 1300 RT can also be fitted with the optional equipment item
  “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the
  additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding
  mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an
  individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable
  number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.

Engine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim.
  This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can
  occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at
  the rear wheel. In these cases, the engine drag control instantly
  opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is
  equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.

With the Automated Shift Assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an
  innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more
  comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch
  operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front
  and centre - without sacrificing the dynamics of the shifting process.

The chassis of the new BMW R 1300 RT has been completely redesigned.
  The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which
  in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space
  for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness
  than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear
  frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous
  tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 RT now has an aluminium
  lattice tube rear frame.

In combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the
  new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass
  towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in
  noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 RT is
  even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less
  effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response
  of the suspension elements.

The front wheel guide in the new R 1300 RT follows the Telelever
  principle introduced by BMW Motorrad 30 years ago - but in an
  innovative, newly designed form that combines the best of both worlds.

With the Evo Telelever, BMW Motorrad now combines the strengths of
  the two previously used Telelever variants in the new BMW R 1300 RT.
  Clamped tightly to the fork tubes - as previously in the sporty design
  - the upper fork construction (as in the GS) incorporates a handlebar
  decoupling system that prevents any detrimental tilting movement and
  only transmits steering forces.

The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 RT has also been redesigned.
  The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer
  connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging
  arm quick-release axle.

The new R 1300 RT features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with
  hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less
  than the existing wheels.

Even the standard Dynamic ESA electronic chassis offers a high level
  of riding safety and riding enjoyment on a wide variety of road
  surfaces thanks to dynamic adjustment of the damping and
  load-dependent adjustment of the rear spring preload.

The electronic Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) now goes one step
  further and, in addition to the familiar Dynamic Suspension Adjustment
  (DSA) options - such as dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and
  load equalisation - offers two rider-selectable riding positions via
  the riding modes for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic
  handling. This makes for an even more thrilling riding experience in
  all conditions.

DCA has been developed with equal emphasis on dynamic performance and
  comfort. The new semi-active chassis offers two different riding
  positions. One riding position has a flat steering head angle and
  therefore a chassis geometry designed to maximise riding stability and
  smoothness. The second riding position features firmer damping tuning,
  a higher spring rate and a higher ride height. Raising the rear end
  more than the front results in a steeper steering head angle and
  reduced castor, making the motorcycle easier to steer and handle. DCA
  makes these two different chassis geometries possible and combines
  them with the riding modes.

The R 1300 RT comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two
  radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single
  disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in
  conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new

BMW R
  1300 RT can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional
  equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with
  titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in
  braking performance.

For decades now, BMW Motorrad has been regarded as a frontrunner when
  it comes to safety in connection with motorcycling. Accordingly, the
  new R 1300 RT comes with state-of-the-art LED light units all around
  as standard. The new full LED headlamp which illuminates the road with
  unrivalled brightness and clarity, underlines the prestige of the new
  R 1300 RT. The light unit consists of an LED module with multiple LEDs
  for low beam and high beam. The daytime running light or position
  light icon (depending on the market), which is positioned to the left
  and right of the headlamp, provides a distinctive look.

Headlight Pro goes one step further available as optional equipment
  ex works. In addition to the adaptive headlight, the headlamp of the
  new R 1300 RT also features pitch compensation - for example when
  accelerating and decelerating as well as for levelling the riding
  position in DCA. Headlight Pro features a servomotor that
  automatically and actively adjusts the position of the cut-off line to
  keep the vertical inclination within the optimum range when the load
  or load status changes.

Headlight Pro can be further enhanced with the optional “Adaptive
  Light Modes” (depending on market), which offer lighting technology
  that intelligently adapts the direction and intensity of the low beam
  to different riding situations. The Adaptive Lighting Modes provide
  optimum lighting conditions for night-time riding with speed-dependent
  road illumination. Lighting is provided in several stages: for low,
  medium and high speeds. Intelligent adaptation to speed and riding
  conditions increases safety and helps to guide the rider.

The new R 1300 RT is already equipped with Dynamic Cruise Control
  (DCC) with braking function as standard. The Riding Assistant offers
  many more functions as an optional extra ex works. It consists of
  Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane
  Change Warning (SWW) and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW).

The R 1300 RT comes fitted as standard with a 10.25-inch TFT colour
  screen with integrated map navigation and newly developed Connectivity
  Hub. With maximum connectivity, excellent readability, clear menu
  navigation and a highly integrated operating concept, the new R 1300
  RT maintains its leading position among production motorcycles.

The “tiles” shown can be used to select the “My Motorcycle”, “Radio”,
  “Navigation”, “Media”, “Phone” and “Settings” menus. A new feature is
  the Connectivity Hub "tile" for connecting current and
  future accessories such as smart glasses, heated vests and lightweight
  jackets. This simplifies the operation of the accessories.

The new R 1300 RT comes as standard with an actively ventilated
  smartphone charging compartment located within the rider's reach. It
  is even easier to open than its predecessor and can accommodate much
  larger smartphones. The smartphone battery is charged via a USB-C
  interface. The lid also has a clip that can be used for a debit card
  or banknotes.

With the Audio System, the new R 1300 RT offers an even more intense
  sound experience. It features a high level of integration with the
  vehicle's electrical system. The menu control, setting options and
  unique display concept make the audio experience perfect in terms of
  interaction as well. In addition to the loudspeakers, a connected
  communication system can also be used for playback.

Audio Pro offers an even more impressive sound experience. Ordered as
  optional equipment to the audio system, it features higher quality
  loudspeakers with separate tweeter/midrange and woofer control for
  extra powerful, crystal-clear sound. A choice of sound profiles and
  dynamic volume control ensure optimum listening pleasure in every
  riding situation. Audio Pro is also a visual highlight. A silver
  perforated grille without fleece provides a clear view of the speakers
  with their gold dust protection dome.

An extensive programme of optional equipment and optional accessories
  is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 RT.
