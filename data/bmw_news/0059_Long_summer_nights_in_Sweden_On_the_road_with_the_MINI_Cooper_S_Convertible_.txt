Days that never end – what sounds like
  pure stress in everyday urban life takes on an entirely different
  twist amid the vast landscape of the archipelago. Around midsummer, in
  the middle of June, hours of sunshine and seemingly endless bright
  nights provide plenty of time to relax outdoors. The MINI Cooper S
  Convertible offers open-top driving fun for an extended summer
  adventure along the Swedish Baltic coast. From Stockholm, a short
  drive on the E18 towards Östhamra is all it takes to leave behind the
  hustle and bustle of the big city. From here, routes 276 and 278 lead
  south-east on small country roads through a picturesque natural
  setting and on to the coast.

The archipelago north-east of
  Stockholm is characterised by the deep cuts made by the Baltic Sea to
  create a rugged coastline. Numerous small islands and an vast expanse
  of water give a sense of endless space. As soon as you lower the top
  of the MINI Cooper S Convertible (fuel consumption combined: 6.6-6.2
  l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 151-141 g/km according to WLTP),
  this impression is reinforced, revealing a view of the numerous wooden
  houses along the shore painted in typical Swedish red. This matte yet
  vibrant colour has its origins in the Swedish mines, where iron
  hydroxide is extracted as a byproduct. When exposed to air, it becomes
  iron oxide – in other words rust. This is what creates the unique and
  typical colouring of the Swedish wooden huts – the bathing houses and
  excursion restaurants that are a typical feature of the landscape
  along the Baltic Sea.

Lots of sunshine through the open roof and the constant view of
  the water intensify the desire to jump into the cool water. Before
  heading deeper into the archipelago, a stop at Solöbadet is a good
  idea. From the water, the MINI Cooper S Convertible with its body in
  Melting Silver III and comfortable leather seats in Chester Malt Brown
  fits perfectly into the scenery on the shore – and makes you want to
  drive on.

After the swim, a short detour leads north. Crossing a small
  bridge, we reach the island of Marholmen, where the decorated maypole
  already stands on the festival meadow of this small islet. As in the
  whole country, the longest day of the year is celebrated here by
  singing and dancing together. Midsummer in Sweden is a time of
  community festivities. Laughter, music and happy get-togethers are the
  stuff of summer memories, making them unforgettable.

Looking out over the
  water glittering in the light, the numerous bays and islands overgrown
  with small forests, you forget the passing of time – especially around
  the time of the Midsummer Festival. This is because it is bright at
  any time of day. But your appetite for the Nordic cuisine with its
  fresh fish and crisp vegetables reminds you in time that it is getting
  late. With acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in just 6.9 seconds and the
  dynamic Steptronic sports automatic transmission, the journey to the
  eastern end of the archipelago continues swiftly, offering typical
  MINI driving pleasure. How fortunate that a restaurant is still open
  on Furusund: it instantly feels like home with its family atmosphere
  and freshly caught food.

As we eat, the spectacle of different hues on the horizon
  unfolds, typical of this time of year. It may be approaching midnight
  now, but instead of being shrouded in deep dark black, the sky glows
  in a fascinating mix of different colours including blue, purple,
  orange and pink. In this unique atmosphere, the top of the MINI Cooper
  S Convertible naturally remains open late at night. The distinctive
  blend of freedom and driving pleasure is a perfect match for the
  Swedish highlight of the summer season and on the return journey to
  Stockholm provides special moments that are just as memorable as the
  surreal light above the winding archipelago.
