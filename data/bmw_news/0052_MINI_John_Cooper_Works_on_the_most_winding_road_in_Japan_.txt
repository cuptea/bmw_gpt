The Japan Mobility Show is a showcase for
  innovation and mobility. Attending the show also provides an
  opportunity to discover the diversity and beauty of Japan away from
  the metropolis of Tokyo. The drive along the Irohazaka Road, a
  spectacular, winding mountain road in the Nikko region, combines
  driving pleasure with breathtaking nature.

The journey begins in the centre of the Japanese capital and
  continues north to Nikko National Park, around 180 km away. The
  Irohazaka Road starts there, connecting Nikko National Park with the
  Oku-Nikko plateau and leading through the most beautiful colours of
  autumn. However, it is not only a scenic highlight, but also a
  challenge for drivers - the perfect stage for cornering fun with the
  MINI John Cooper Works. Equipped with a powerful 2.0-litre
  four-cylinder twin-turbo petrol engine with 231 hp (170 kW) and a
  maximum torque of 380 Nm, each of the 48 bends becomes pure driving pleasure.

The seven-speed automatic transmission with dual clutch gives the
  powerful three-door model intense acceleration, perfect for winding
  roads. Standard paddle shifters offer the driver additional control
  over performance. The specially tuned suspension provides the typical
  go-kart feeling with agile handling, while the Chilli Red painted
  brake system with JCW logo guarantees maximum braking precision and
  safety even in demanding situations.

Whether in the city, on narrow mountain roads or in open passages -
  the MINI John Cooper Works impresses with its outstanding driving
  dynamics and agile handling, which make it the ideal companion for
  demanding roads and adventurous journeys. The drive along the
  Irohazaka road emphasises the core values of the MINI brand: Passion,
  precision and pure driving pleasure.
