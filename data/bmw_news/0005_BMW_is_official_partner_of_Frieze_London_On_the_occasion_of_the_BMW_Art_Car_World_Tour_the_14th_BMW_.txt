From October 15 to 19, Frieze London
  and Frieze Masters will return to London’s Regent’s Park. As one of
  Frieze’s long-standing global partners since 2004, BMW honours the
  artistic work of David Hockney as part of the BMW Art Car World Tour
  and provides VIP shuttle service. Frieze London takes its place on the
  global stage as part of the ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a
  journey that will span continents and continue well into 2026. Marking
  the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a
  constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enriched by a
  vibrant array of events.

The iconic Art Car #14, designed by David Hockney 30 years ago, will
  be on display in The Lobby of The Peninsula London from October 14 to
  November 3. During the “Peninsula Classic Car Afternoon Tea” which
  runs through November 18 there will be a special opportunity to engage
  with Hockney’s Art Car: BMW representatives will dive deep into the
  origins and lead through the journey of Hockney’s Art Car design on
  October 14 and 15. Sculptural culinary delights will be served to
  bring together the British tea tradition and the BMW Art Cars’ golden
  jubilee. The final days of the exhibition coincide with RM Sotheby’s
  Classic Car auction presented in partnership with the Royal Automobile
  Club which brings a selection of significant automobiles– from
  historic treasures to modern collectibles – to The Peninsula.

puts a new spin on the
  traditional idea of a car’s paintwork by effectively turning the car
  inside out. “I thought it would be a good idea to show the car as if
  one could see inside,” he said. Like an X-ray, Hockney’s design
  reveals the anatomy of the car and its occupants: the door sports an
  outline of the driver, and Hockney’s loyal dachshund, Stanley, can be
  seen sitting on the back seat, referencing the artist’s love of his
  dogs. Stylised engine components are depicted on the bonnet, while
  expanses of green sweep across the body – a visual metaphor for the
  passing scenery, movement, and time. Hockney’s visual language melds
  the car’s interior and the outside world to create a new and unusual
  perspective on motoring.

Born in Bradford, England, in 1937,

has been one of the most flamboyant and influential protagonists on
  the international art scene since the early 1960s. He graduated from
  the Royal College of Art in 1962 and soon joined the exclusive circles
  of Swinging Sixties London. He established his style as his very own
  form of international Pop Art and achieved great popularity with it.
  His works – among them iconic images depicting swimming pools and
  Californian landscapes – illustrate his lifelong fascination with
  light, colour, and the relationship between perspective and movement.
  David Hockney’s Art Car was intended solely as an exhibition piece and
  has never been driven on the road or in a race.

The BMW Art Car World Tour charts an ambitious course, with stops at
  prestigious destinations such as Art Basel Hong Kong, the Le Mans
  Classic in France, Belgium’s Zoute Grand Prix, the Shanghai Motor Show
  in China, and Italy’s Concorso d’Eleganza, among others. Showcasing
  the collection of 20 iconic BMW Art Cars, the tour serves as a
  testament to the company’s deep-rooted commitment to global cultural
  engagement – spanning more than a hundred initiatives across
  contemporary art, music, film, and design. Follow the journey
