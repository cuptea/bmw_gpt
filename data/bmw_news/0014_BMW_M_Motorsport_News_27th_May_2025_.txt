“The 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers were the biggest event of the past
  weekend for our customer teams – and a major success. The BMW M2
  Racing performed excellently under typically chaotic Eifel conditions
  and proved that it delivers everything we expect from our new
  entry-level race car. Many thanks to the team at FK Performance
  Motorsport, the drivers, and the BMW M Motorsport engineers for this
  strong and professional performance. With a total of 13 class
  victories, our teams have demonstrated that they are capable of
  winning with various BMW M Motorsport race cars – and will certainly
  play a leading role in the 24-hour race. That only increases my
  anticipation for the season highlight. Congratulations also to BMW
  Italia Ceccato Racing and Century Motorsport on their successes in the
  Italian GT and British GT. The ‘Crazy Month of June’ with three major
  24-hour races in a row – along with many other customer racing
  highlights – can come!”

The BMW M2 Racing experienced the full toughness of the “Green Hell”
  last weekend at the 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers, passing its ultimate
  test ahead of the endurance classic in June with flying colors. The
  first of two four-hour races on Saturday evening in particular, held
  in pouring rain, put the new BMW M Motorsport entry-level race car,
  the FK Performance Motorsport team, and the three drivers – BMW M
  works drivers Ugo de Wilde and Charles Weerts (both BEL), along with
  motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER) – to the test. The BMW
  M2 Racing ran flawlessly however, and crossed the finish line second
  in its SP3T class. In Sunday’s race, the car emerged largely unscathed
  from an unavoidable collision and secured third place in class.

“The BMW M2 Racing completed both races without any technical
  problems,” said Weerts. “It’s a lot of fun to drive. It has a lot of
  mechanical grip, which allows for quite high cornering speeds. Even
  under Saturday’s extreme conditions with heavy rain, the car gave us a
  good feeling and performed strongly. On Sunday I was hit pretty hard
  by another competitor, but there was hardly any damage to the car, and
  we were able to finish the weekend successfully and gain a lot of
  insights.” De Wilde added: “It was my first time with the BMW M2
  Racing on the Nordschleife – and it was a fantastic experience. I
  earned my permit with the BMW M240i Racing, and the differences to the
  new car are enormous. The BMW M2 Racing is easier to drive, the
  suspension and brakes are significantly improved. I felt very
  comfortable. For me personally, it was important to get to know the
  Nordschleife better – especially under crazy conditions. After this
  weekend, I understand why it’s called the ‘Green Hell’. Still, I’m
  really looking forward to the 24-hour race.”

The 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers were generally a great success for the
  BMW M Motorsport teams. With six class wins on Saturday and seven on
  Sunday, the teams had an impressive dress rehearsal for June’s season
  highlight. The new BMW M4 GT4 EVO dominated the SP8T class with
  quadruple victories on both days. First place on each occasion went to
  FK Performance Motorsport. A BMW M4 GT4 EVO also competed in the AT3
  class, where the Giti Tire Motorsport by WS Racing team won both
  races. No BMW M4 GT3 EVO participated in the top SP9 class. ROWE
  Racing will return to action at the 24-hour race.

BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER) and Jesse Krohn (FIN), along
  with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing, made a strong start to the Sprint
  season of the Italian GT Championship at Vallelunga (ITA). Klingmann
  and the team led by Roberto Ravaglia (ITA) are defending champions,
  and Krohn has now rejoined as a full-time driver for the sprint races.
  In the first race on Saturday, the duo took victory in the #1 BMW M4
  GT3 EVO. Due to regulations, they had to serve pit stop penalties in
  Sunday’s race but still managed seventh overall and fifth in the GT3
  Pro class.

“Vallelunga was a very strong weekend for us,” said Klingmann. “With
  Saturday’s win, we’ve started our title defense mission for the third
  year in a row. That gave us and the team a lot of confidence that
  we’re competitive and can fight for the title again. On Sunday, we
  tried to make the most of the pit stop penalties, which are based on
  Saturday’s results, and to limit the damage. At the next sprint race
  at Mugello, we’ll be penalty-free again and ready to go all out. Our
  mission this year is clear: we want to defend the title. I’m very
  happy to have made a strong statement with Roberto Ravaglia’s team and
  my teammate Jesse.”

“I’m very happy to be back with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing in the
  Italian GT Championship, and it was great to start the season with a
  win,” said Krohn. “I’m here to help the team win a third title, and
  I’ll do everything I can to make that happen. I’m also thrilled to be
  racing with Jens again. He was one of my first teammates when I joined
  BMW M Motorsport eleven years ago.”

Their teammates William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA)
  also started the Sprint season successfully in the #2 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.
  On Saturday, they finished third overall and took victory in the GT3
  Pro-Am class. On Sunday, however, the duo retired early.

Fans witnessed two dramatic races in the British GT Championship on
  Monday at Oulton Park (GBR). Branden Templeton and Chris Salkeld (both
  GBR) claimed their first win of the season in the #14 BMW M4 GT4 EVO
  from Century Motorsport after previously scoring two second-place
  finishes. They won the GT4 Silver class in the first race and took
  third overall among the GT4 cars. In the second race, which saw some
  rain-related chaos, they finished second in their class and returned
  to the podium.

Things took a dramatic turn on Monday for their teammates Ravi
  Ramyead and Charlie Robertson (both GBR) in the #71 BMW M4 GT4 EVO.
  After a win and a second-place finish earlier in the season, they
  arrived at Oulton Park as GT4 class leaders. In the first race,
  Ramyead built a solid lead in the GT4 field – but then suffered a
  heavy crash into the barriers. The good news was that Ramyead was
  uninjured. Unfortunately, the #71 was too badly damaged to compete in
  the second race of the day.

In the GT4 drivers’ standings of the British GT Championship, Ramyead
  and Robertson now sit in second place after four races, directly
  followed by Templeton/Salkeld in third.
