BMW M Team RMG is once again relying on a young, highly talented
  line-up of drivers in 2024, with three members of the Gen2K group
  created by BMW M Motorsport (BMW M works drivers born in 2000 or
  later). Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) will compete for the
  fourth time together with the team led by Team Principal Stefan
  Reinhold in the top class at the 24-hour race. Joining them in the
  cockpit of the #72 BMW M4 GT3, sporting the design of BMW M Motorsport
  Premium Technology Partner Shell, is Charles Weerts (BEL). The
  23-year-old will make his debut at the 24h Nürburgring but already has
  an impressive and successful GT3 career, especially in the Fanatec GT
  World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, where he was the overall winner
  in 2021. In recent weeks, Weerts, Harper, and Hesse have already
  completed several test laps on the Nordschleife and have been
  intensively preparing for their race entries.

ROWE Racing will field two cars. This coming weekend, BMW M works
  drivers Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Maxime Martin (BEL), and Marco
  Wittmann (GER) will take turns in the #98 BMW M4 GT3. In the sister
  #99 car, Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), and Dries
  Vanthoor (BEL) will be in the cockpit. As the seventh driver, Robin
  Frijns (NED) will compete in the 24-hour race, however he will be
  absent from the Qualifiers due to a scheduling conflict with Formula
  E. Nevertheless, Frijns has also managed to complete several test laps
  on the Nordschleife in the past weeks.

At the season opener of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) last
  weekend, no BMW M4 GT3 could take part because most drivers were
  participating in the concurrent GT World Challenge Europe event at Le
  Castellet (FRA), where Harper, Hesse, and Farfus won together with the
  ROWE Racing Team.

Good news for all BMW fans came a few weeks ago at the start of the
  Nürburgring season. From the 2024 season, BMW is the official vehicle
  partner of the Nürburgring. At least until 2026, the service and track
  safety vehicles for the racetrack staff will come from BMW. In
  addition to the existing commitment of BMW M at the Nürburgring, the
  newly decided vehicle partnership represents a further expansion of
  collaboration and the presence of BMW at the legendary racetrack.

A total of 25 new BMWs will initially strengthen the Nürburgring's
  fleet. Nine of them will be used on the racetrack as part of track
  safety. Eight BMW 3 Series Touring and one BMW X1 will be deployed on
  the Nordschleife and Grand Prix circuit to ensure safety. For this
  purpose, the vehicles will be given a distinctive Nürburgring design
  with warning elements to be easily noticed by all racetrack users,
  such as tourist drivers or participants in driver training sessions.
  As service vehicles, the 1 Series, 3 Series, and the X1 and X3 will be
  available to employees, also featuring design elements of the
  Nürburgring silhouette and the Nürburgring logo, making them appealing
  representatives of the versatile event location.

“The 24h
  Nürburgring Qualifiers are very important for us, as they are every
  year. This coming weekend, we will test all our race procedures and
  prepare ourselves as well as possible for the season highlight. Our
  advantage is that the BMW M Motorsport engineers, as well as our teams
  ROWE Racing and RMG, have a lot of experience on the Nordschleife and
  do not need much time to optimally adjust to the 24-hour race.
  Accordingly, we approach the coming weeks with confidence. Seeing that
  BMW is now even more prominently represented at the Nürburgring as the
  official vehicle partner pleases me greatly. The brand is extremely
  popular with fans – whether in racing or for everyone on the road.”

“This season, the preparation for the 24-hour race is extremely short.
  Therefore, the two races we will compete in this coming weekend are
  all the more important. Our team now has experience on the
  Nordschleife, which will surely help us. Nevertheless, it is always
  about training all procedures under competitive conditions to be
  optimally coordinated when it comes to racing in the big one in June.
  We have already completed several test days under various weather
  conditions in advance, during which we covered many kilometres and
  collected valuable data. Our new driver Charles Weerts also had plenty
  of time to adjust to our team and the BMW M4 GT3 on the Nordschleife.
  He has made a great impression and harmonises very well with Dan
  Harper and Max Hesse. I am convinced that we will present ourselves as
  a strong team.”

“After the fantastic start to the season at Le Castellet, we want to
  continue in the same vein this coming weekend. The Qualifiers are not
  just a preparation programme for the big race at the beginning of June
  for us. We want to race this weekend, push hard, and as always, fight
  for podium places. Our driver line-up is already well sorted out; five
  of the six BMW M works drivers who will be competing this weekend know
  the team and our processes, some for many years. The schedule gives us
  enough opportunity to give Raffaele Marciello as many kilometres as
  possible in the BMW M4 GT3 on the Nordschleife.”
