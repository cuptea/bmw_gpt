The Suzuka 8 Hours has always been the most important race of the
  year for Japanese manufacturers, who field numerous well-staffed
  teams. In preparation for the weekend, the BMW Motorrad World
  Endurance Team has already completed two test days at Suzuka in June
  which will be followed by additional test sessions this Wednesday. One
  challenge for everyone at Suzuka is the climate; high temperatures
  combined with very high humidity are a hallmark of this race event.

In addition to the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, no fewer than
  five private BMW teams will compete at Suzuka. In the Formula EWC
  class, these teams are Team TARO PLUSONE with SDG (#6) featuring Taro
  Sekiguchi (JPN), Kyosuke Okuda (JPN), and reigning Canadian Superbike
  Champion Ben Young (CAN), Team SHINSYUREN With TOTEC (#42) with Isami
  Higashimura, Shuichiro Nakamura, and Tatsuya Nakamura (all JPN), and
  Team Frontier (#96) with Azlan Shah Kamaruzaman (MAS), Kevin Manfredi
  (ITA), and Chris Leesch (LUX). In the Superstock class, BMW Motorrad
  colours will be represented by Team Étoile (#25) with Yudai Kamei
  (JPN), Hikari Okubo (JPN), and Roberto Rolfo (ITA), as well as TONE RT
  SYNCEDGE 4413 BMW (#95) with Tomoya Hoshino (JPN), Ainosuke Yoshida
  (JPN), and BMW Motorrad rider Hannes Soomer (EST).

Qualifying for the 45th edition of the Suzuka 8 Hours will take place
  on Friday, 19th July. On Saturday, 20th July, the top ten grid
  positions will be determined in the Top 10 Trial. The eight-hour race
  starts on Sunday, 21st July, at 11:30 local time (04:30 CEST), with
  the finish at 19:30 (12:30 CEST).

“The Suzuka 8 Hours has always been a very
  special race and a major challenge. There are the many factory and
  factory-supported teams from Japan, and unique climatic conditions.
  The track layout also has its own character. However, last year we saw
  how well the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team handled these
  challenges. A similarly strong result, and thus many points for the
  championship, is the goal for the weekend. With a second-place podium
  finish at the Le Mans season opener, we have already demonstrated the
  potential of our package of bike, riders, and team very well. We were
  also very strong at Spa-Francorchamps, but due to a technical problem,
  we couldn’t convert that into a corresponding result. I am keeping my
  fingers crossed for the team, as well as for the many private BMW
  teams competing at Suzuka.”

“Suzuka is always a very special race so
  I’m looking forward to going there. We had a good two-day test a few
  weeks ago which was interesting and allowed us to get really prepared
  for it. It’s a very challenging race, very hot and difficult
  conditions but I love stuff like that. It’s going to push everybody to
  the limit. It’s only an 8-hour race but it’s very fast paced, a lot of
  competitive teams and packages. We have to push really hard and
  hopefully come away with some strong points for the championship.”

“All eyes are on the Japan race. I missed
  the test a few weeks ago but the guys did a great job. They tested a
  lot of tyres and new things on the bike. It looks like we have a
  better package than last year and can be more competitive. We go there
  with a lot of motivation and try to fight with the strong Japanese
  guys and teams to show our good performance over there. Let’s hope for
  a strong result. For sure it will not be an easy race, the weather
  seems to be hot again with high humidity. We need to fully focus on
  the first day of test there on Wednesday and try to find a good pace
  on this track and a good set-up for all riders. We will try our best
  and let’s hope for a good one.”

“We are travelling to Suzuka with
  excitement and a lot of motivation. We already had a very positive
  test there. I think that Dunlop Japan has a few more tyre options
  there that should bring us closer to the top. Overall, we aim for a
  similar result as last year. Achieving more there is a challenge, but
  we are giving it our all. The bike is working well, we’ve made some
  improvements again, the team is strong, and we will do our best.
  Suzuka is always something special, and we are looking forward to it.”
