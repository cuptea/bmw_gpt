Comfortably rest your hands in your lap and
  initiate overtaking maneuvers with a glance in the wing mirror – BMW
  customers will soon be able to experience this in many more European
  countries with the Motorway Assistant*. The BMW Group is the first car
  manufacturer in Germany to receive approval for driver assistance
  systems for the new BMW iX3 in accordance with UN Regulation No. 171
  for Driver Control Assistance Systems (DCAS). The DCAS regulation
  provides an international legal framework for innovative Level 2
  driver assistance systems with a focus on customer safety. The
  approval enables the BMW Group to offer the Motorway Assistant* with
  Level 2 "hands-off" function in numerous other models and
  countries in the future, as well as with an extended range of
  functions. Further innovative assistance functions will also follow
  for urban driving scenarios. The current generation of the Motorway
  Assistant has just been awarded the Tech Award in the "Comfort
  assistance systems" category by the German car magazine
  "auto motor und sport".

"The safety-oriented DCAS-regulation ensures that we can launch
  our Motorway Assistant with hands-off function in many more countries.
  Further innovative assistance systems with our special, symbiotic
  approach between vehicle and driver will follow. We are creating a
  perfect interplay between rule-based algorithms and artificial
  intelligence. The driver remains involved, our systems are
  controllable at all times, and their behaviour is reproducible."

When the Motorway Assistant is activated, drivers can take their
  hands off the steering wheel permanently at speeds of up to 130 km/h,
  but must remain attentive and ready to intervene. The system assists
  with vehicle guidance within its own lane and can also change lanes
  automatically if necessary - all the driver needs to do is confirm
  this with a glance. The new DCAS approval also enables even more
  extensive functions. With active BMW Maps route guidance, the system
  suggests a lane change in good time at Motorway junctions and exits,
  which can be confirmed with a glance in the wing mirror. The Motorway
  Assistant remains active when driving through freeway junctions and
  until the end of freeway exits. This means that drivers of the BMW iX3
  can enjoy Level 2 driver assistance in even more situations without
  touching the steering wheel.

The new Motorway and City Assistant* of the BMW iX3 also offers
  innovative functions for urban areas. At market launch in Germany,
  these include stopping at red lights and driving off again
  automatically. Further driver assistance functions for complex driving
  situations in urban areas will be rolled out at a later point in time
  via over-the-air software updates.

The Motorway Assistant of the previous technology generation
  celebrated its premiere in the current 5 Series Sedan in 2023. The BMW
  Group had received a limited exemption from the Federal Motor
  Transport Authority in Germany for the approval of the system. With
  DCAS approval, exemptions are no longer required, and the systems can
  be offered throughout Europe and in other ECE countries.

In addition to the new possibilities offered by the DCAS regulation
  for driver assistance systems, the BMW Group continues to consistently
  design its systems so that driver and driver assistance work together
  symbiotically. BMW Symbiotic Drive creates a seamless transition
  between assistance and driver input and reaches the next level of
  development in the “Neue Klasse” vehicles. In addition to symbiotic
  steering, the BMW iX3 is the world's first model with symbiotic
  brakes. With active driver assistance, the driver can influence the
  system individually at any time according to their wishes by lightly
  intervening in steering and braking without switching off the driver
  assistance. The system remains active to provide support. The
  innovative power of the symbiotic brake is underpinned by more than
  two dozen BMW Group patent applications resulting from the development
  of these technologies.
