‘Always Open’ – even when the weather in
  the southern English coastal towns between Portsmouth and Dover is
  more British than sunny: in the MINI Cooper Convertible S (fuel
  consumption combined: 6.6 - 6.5 l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 150
  - 148 g/km according to WLTP; CO2 class: E), it's not just sunny hours
  that make for a great driving experience. The Always Open Timer counts
  the driving time with the top down and motivates you to take a spin in
  the fresh air. The fully electric roof opens in just 18 seconds. With
  precise steering and agile handling, every bend becomes an adventure.
  The two-litre petrol engine with 204 hp, which sprints from 0 to 100
  km/h in 6.9 seconds with a maximum torque of 300 Nm, delivers dynamic
  drive and sound.

With this release, we are providing new images of the MINI
  Cooper Convertible S.
