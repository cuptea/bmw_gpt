In Saturday morning’s Superpole qualifying session, Sykes was the
  highest-placed BMW rider in eighth position. However, he had some bad
  luck in the closely contested session. On his second run, he was on
  his way to a standout lap time but was slowed by a yellow flag in the
  final sector. Gerloff followed in tenth place, Redding finished
  twelfth, and Baz ended Superpole in fifteenth position.

In the first race on Saturday afternoon, Sykes maintained a position
  in the top-eight until the final lap, while Redding steadily climbed
  up from twelfth place. Just before the finish line, Redding overtook
  Sykes, crossing the line in eighth position and achieving his
  second-best race result of the season. Sykes finished directly behind
  in ninth place. Unfortunately, the first race didn’t go well for the
  Bonovo action BMW Racing Team. Gerloff was touched by another rider in
  the first corner and crashed. Although he initially continued the race
  after a quick check in the garage, he had to retire prematurely. Baz
  retired due to a technical issue.

The goal in Sunday’s Superpole race was to improve on the starting
  positions for the second main race in the afternoon. Gerloff succeeded
  by working his way up to seventh place, while Redding finished ninth.
  Sykes was in eighth place until the penultimate lap but then crashed.
  He resumed the race and finished in 18th position. Baz had an early
  fall in the race but was also able to continue and crossed the finish
  line in 23rd place.

After the restart of Sunday’s second main race, Redding initially
  held eighth position before steadily advancing through the field in
  the second half of the race. On the 19th out of a total of 22 laps, he
  moved up to fourth place and successfully defended it until the end.
  That secured his best race result of the season so far. Gerloff had a
  great start and held fifth position for a long time but dropped back
  slightly in the field to finish ninth, securing another top-ten result.

The seventh round of the WorldSBK 2023 will take place from 14th to
  16th July at Imola, Italy.

As part of the WorldSBK support programme, the ABK Beer 0% BMW F 900
  R Cup made its appearance at Donington Park. The one-make cup, which
  has its debut season in 2023, offers highly competitive and
  cost-effective racing. The races take place during weekends of the
  British Superbike Championship, in addition to the WorldSBK event at
  Donington Park. The riders compete on identical BMW F 900 R Roadster
  bikes with 105 horsepower.

The third event of the season’s BMW F 900 R Cup races provided
  thrilling action. On Saturday, two heats of eight laps each were on
  the schedule. In the first race, Richard Cooper (GBR / FHO Racing BMW
  Motorrad) claimed victory ahead of Thomas Strudwick (GBR / Art of
  Racing) and Barry Burrell (GBR / Mallory Performance Racing). In the
  second race, Nikki Coates (GBR / Ernie Coates Track Days/AOR Racing)
  took the win, followed by Michael Rutter (GBR / Bathams Racing) and
  Christian Smith (GBR / SCH Motoprep/Smith Twins Racing). The main race
  over 14 laps took place on Sunday afternoon. This time, Cooper secured
  a clear victory, with Strudwick and Rutter completing the podium. The
  winner’s trophies were presented by Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad.

“It
  was a weekend that we conclude with mixed emotions. The weekend
  started off difficult due to the unpredictable weather. Both practice
  sessions on Friday had partly wet conditions, making it challenging to
  prepare for the races, but that applied to everyone, of course. Even
  in FP3 on Saturday morning, there were damp patches on the track, and
  qualifying was more or less the first dry session. We were performing
  quite well there. Tom had the potential to put the bike on the front
  row in ‘Tomington’ but he was unlucky with the yellow flag. With the
  other guys, we didn't immediately find the right setup for the newly
  resurfaced track due to the lack of time in the practice sessions,
  however we had a stable pace with good results in the first race.
  Therefore, we started Sunday with confidence. Garrett also showed a
  good and consistent performance in the Superpole race, improving to
  seventh place. Tom also gave a strong performance with stable lap
  times but had a small slide. As a result, Scott took ninth place. We
  had a good pace in this race as well.

The second main race started with Tom’s terrible crash, which
  subsequently affected Loris and Michael Ruben Rinaldi. It has just
  been confirmed that Tom has multiple rib fractures. He is currently
  undergoing further examinations in the hospital. We wish him a speedy
  recovery, and at this point, as BMW Motorrad, we would also like to
  send our best wishes to Michael. Fortunately, Loris was relatively
  okay after the accident, but he had fallen on his head and decided not
  to participate in the restart. Garrett had a very good start but then
  dropped back a bit. Scott grew stronger throughout the race, ploughed
  through the field, and in an extremely exciting battle, especially
  against the Kawasakis, secured a very strong fourth place. Just under
  two seconds behind, Garrett crossed the finish line in ninth place.
  These are pleasing results, especially with fourth place not far from
  the podium. We will carry this positive momentum with us to Imola.”

“Today has been pretty good. Warm
  up wasn’t the best for me so I thought it is going to be a hard day.
  The Superpole race was not bad and I finished ninth. I needed to be up
  there for race two. You saw the difference it makes as I had a good
  start. Unfortunately there was this accident, so I send my wishes to
  Tom and Michael. At the re–start, I got through pretty cleanly, and I
  do generally struggle at the start of the race to go with the front
  guys a little bit more. Then I thought to just keep the pressure on
  because I knew I come stronger. I was believing in myself to come
  better in the end. I had Petrucci in front and he was a bit faster so
  I could not get him but I got the Yamaha and I got the Kawasakis and
  just pushed until the end. It would have been nice to have a podium
  but to have a ride like that after such a difficult season is great.”

): “I was really, really happy in
  the Superpole race. The bike felt so good for the first time this
  weekend. We’ve been playing with some different settings and finally
  on Sunday in the Superpole race everything felt super good. So, I was
  able to finish in the top nine places in seventh position. That was
  really positive for myself and the whole team. In race two, I got a
  great start after the red flag and was in fifth place. I felt so good,
  then I just struggled to maintain the pace. I was fighting with some
  arm fatigue. It wasn’t arm pump, I was just losing strength in my arm
  and that made it difficult to be consistent. I made a couple of stupid
  mistakes and people passed me, but in the end I was still with the
  group with Scott and the other guys. That was super positive and I’m
  very happy about that. We’re getting closer and closer and I know
  we’re going in a good direction. This is what makes me happy and I’m
  really excited for the next round at Imola.”

): “Unfortunately, there is not so
  much to say about today. First of all, I want to send my best wishes
  to Tom and Michael. I hope they are ok. It was so scary! I’m just glad
  that I didn’t hit Tom. There was just nothing I could have done. The
  consequence could have been much worse. We’ve just been lacking luck
  all weekend with some technical issues, rain and all the problems. I
  couldn’t do more than six, seven laps in a row, so it was hard for me
  to keep the pace and I felt I was running behind. I tried to catch
  back the speed during the whole weekend. I’m just disappointed, as
  Donington is a track that I really like and I felt the BMW could do
  well. Garrett and Scott have shown that in race two. Now, I’m just
  trying to get some sleep, because I have a big headache from the
  crash. Now we’ll regroup and start again from Imola. Thanks to all the
  Bonovo action BMW Racing Team guys for the hard work again. We try
  harder than anyone and we will try harder next time. We’ll stay strong.”
