Starting today, BMW customers in France and
  Germany can activate the Personal eSIM of their vehicle with
  Transatel’s Ubigi 5G data plans to enjoy additional infotainment
  features and WiFi connectivity, irrespective of their primary network
  operator for their regular smartphone subscription. The service will
  be available for BMW vehicles with BMW Operating System 8, 8.5 and 9*
  with the option Personal eSIM (SA6PA). Depending on the vehicle model,
  the Personal eSIM enables the in-vehicle WiFi-Hotspot, first-row video
  streaming services and in the case of 7 series vehicles equipped with
  the BMW Theatre Screen, a wide variety of entertainment powered by
  Amazon Fire TV.

Following Germany and France, the service will soon be rolled
  out to other European countries, too. To activate it in eligible BMW
  vehicles, owners can conveniently configure their Personal eSIM
  through the My BMW App and subscribe to Ubigi’s European data plans
  (EU 27 + UK + CH). Cost of the service is €10 per month for unlimited
  data allowance**.

“The partnership with Ubigi now
  offers our customers additional flexibility connecting their vehicle
  with an unlimited data plan. This enables even more digital content in
  our BMW fleet.”

“Since 2018, our footprint in the connected car industry has
  been significantly growing and we look forward to our extended
  connectivity partnership with BMW Group in the coming years,”
    said
