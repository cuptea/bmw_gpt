On 1 November, the PUMA x BMW M
  Motorsport Art Car Capsule Collection by Cao Fei was officially
  unveiled at the M Festival at Chengdu Tianfu International Raceway
  (China). The Chinese multimedia artist designed BMW Art Car #18, which
  debuted in 2017, on the basis of a BMW M6 GT3. By presenting the first
  digital Art Car, Cao Fei took the series into the 21st century.
  Physical and virtual elements combine to form a parallel, transmedia
  world that can only be fully experienced through augmented reality
  (AR) and film. In this way, Cao Fei mirrors the rapid pace of
  technological change in China, building a bridge between tradition and
  the future. Accordingly, the new BMW Lifestyle collection presents
  itself as a capsule of wearable art, reimagined with many new
  tech-inspired details, AR-style graphics, and glow-in-the-dark design elements.

The M Festival in Chengdu in early November brought together
  thousands of BMW M enthusiasts. It celebrated the brand’s motorsport
  tradition, and its high-performance models. A highlight of the event
  was the keynote session with Chinese artist Cao Fei. She provided
  insights into the creation of BMW Art Car #18, which she designed to
  connect the real and digital worlds. And Cao Fei herself explained
  how, in collaboration with PUMA, this concept was turned into a
  physical BMW Lifestyle collection.

The exclusive PUMA x BMW M Motorsport Art Car Capsule Collection by
  Cao Fei comprises five pieces. They all represent different aspects of
  the Art Car #18 design. To reflect the project’s connection to the
  digital world, selected details feature glow-in-the-dark elements.
  These add another visual highlight to the collection, which is now
  available worldwide, including at the
