On the occasion of this new edition of
  Paris Photo at the Grand Palais, BMW France unveils the exhibition
  “Crossing the Missing Fragment”, by artist Raphaëlle Peria and curator
  Fanny Robin, the duo laureates of the BMW ART MAKERS mentoring programme.

For more than 50 years, BMW has affirmed its
  lasting commitment to culture, convinced that artists are trailblazers
  who can anticipate and reveal the major issues of their era.
  Supporting creation means supporting those who shape tomorrow’s perspectives.

For 23 years, this role has been notably expressed through this
  partnership with Paris Photo. By supporting the international
  photographic and artistic scene, BMW provides decisive visibility to
  emerging talents. Many artists supported by the programme have since
  achieved major recognition, confirming the strength and relevance of
  this commitment.

This ongoing dialogue between artistic innovation, society, and
  business reflects a shared desire: to embed culture for the long term
  and make it accessible to all, both today and for future generations.

“Together, we make culture shine today and for future generations, by
  valuing its longevity in a world where everything speeds up,”

“Trees are living beings that carry our memory;
  they are the guardians of our secrets.”

The second part of the exhibition, created by the duo laureates of
  the BMW ART MAKERS programme, is presented in November under the Grand
  Palais’s dome in Paris. First unveiled this summer at the 56th edition
  of the Rencontres d’Arles, at the Cloître Saint-Trophime, the
  exhibition has been reinvented for Paris Photo and enriched with
  approximately ten new works. For the occasion, the set design has been
  entirely rethought and specially conceived to enhance this new chapter.

, thus presents the project
  as follows: “Embarking on the journey at the heart of the exhibition
  Crossing the Missing Fragment is to retrace the thread of water and
  time. Through this project, Raphaëlle Peria offers us an intimate
  archaeology of the image, where personal memory engages in dialogue
  with the universal.

After its initial presentation at the Rencontres d’Arles, this second
  part of the exhibition conceived for Paris Photo is unveiled as an
  even more immersive traverse of the landscape. With a renewed
  scenography designed as a space of resonance that interacts
  transparently with the Grand Palais’s glass roof, the exhibition takes
  on a decidedly different form. A series of new works, created
  specifically for the occasion, subtly resonates with the venue’s

At the pinnacle of this installation, a copper wallpaper with ardent
  reflections envelops the space like a fresco-palimpsest, blurring the
  lines between archival images and representations of a present
  environment. Through this revised approach, new sensitive strata
  unfold within the space, bearing witness to the uniqueness of
  Raphaëlle Peria’s gaze and singular gesture.

The project begins with the discovery of an exhumed photo album, a
  relic from a childhood journey aboard a barge, initiating this new
  creation. Family archives, long buried, revive fragmentary memories
  and become the foundation of an exploration where memories confront
  the evolution of the landscape. Thirty years later, Raphaëlle Peria
  returns to the places once crossed. She finds a nature in peril: the
  plane trees along the Canal du Midi, rotting from within due to the
  colored canker, now embody a slow disappearance. Confronted with this
  silent erosion, the artist tirelessly scratches the surface of images,
  revealing through subtraction the imprint of passing time. With
  complete transparency, she translates the fragility of life through
  the very material of photography.”

brings together and
  supports an emerging visual artist and a curator in the creation of a
  collaborative artistic project.

The laureate duo, composed of an artist and a curator, receives a
  grant of 33,000 euros which covers the scholarship as well as the
  research and production budget for the works. The project is presented
  each year at the Rencontres d'Arles and then at Paris Photo, of which
  BMW is an official partner.
