.  2025 sees the Bavarian capital host the
  annual One Young World Summit, a top conference of young leaders from
  across the globe. With delegates from 196 countries, the Summit is one
  of the few global events to bring young people from all continents
  together and offer them a platform. It is now being hosted by the City
  of Munich – for a second time. With its special mix of tradition,
  innovation and quality of life, Munich is the ideal place to pursue
  the shared goal of developing innovative and visionary solutions to
  social challenges.

Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,
  responsible for HR and Real Estate, said: “The One Young World Summit
  2025 in Munich brings together young leaders from across the globe to
  inspire and connect. For us at the BMW Group, social responsibility
  extends far beyond our products and organisation: by supporting One
  Young World, we foster responsible leadership and encourage young
  people to take a stand and remain committed to resolving the
  challenges of the future.”

A premium partner of One Young World, the BMW Group plays an active
  role in the event series. It sees itself as an integral part of
  society and supports the development of solutions to meet global
  challenges. One aspect of this consists of fostering a generation of
  future leaders dedicated to achieving a responsible, just and
  forward-looking society. Since 2016 the BMW Group has had its own
  delegation of committed young leaders aged between 18 and 30 at the
  four-day forum, which it sees as an opportunity to contribute to a
  better future. This year it will once again be staging the closing
  ceremony at BMW Welt – a symbol of technology, design and emotional experiences.

The One Young World Summit is an invitation to debate social,
  business and environmental issues, share knowledge and experience, ask
  critical questions and make lasting connections. The aim is to enable
  talented and ambitious young people to actively drive change.
  Delegates come from a variety of backgrounds, from business and
  science to NGOs. It’s in this diversity and passionate commitment that
  the BMW Group sees the potential of the international conference.

With a BMW Group delegation of more than 50 people, this year’s event
  will focus on education, the circular economy, responsible tech,
  combating hatred, and on peace and security. For even more impetus and
  different perspectives, a range of influential figures from business,
  politics, sport and culture will make guest appearances. One of them
  will be Philipp Lahm, former captain of the German national football
  team and 2014 football World Champion. He will be talking to Ilka
  Horstmeier at the opening ceremony of the Summit on 3 November in
  Munich’s Olympic Hall.

In a podium discussion during the four-day conference, Ilka
  Horstmeier will explore how effective leadership can help restore
  trust in institutions, science and democracy, and the key role of
  education in this. Her panellists will be His Excellency Miguel Ángel
  Moratinos, Under-General-Secretary of the United Nations and High
  Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations
  (UNAOC), and Gabriela de la Torre, responsible for gifted and talented
  education at the Mexican Ministry of Education and General Director of
  the Programa Adopted un Talento (Adopt a Talent Programme, PAUTA),
  which is dedicated to providing extra-curricular activities to support
  children and young people across Mexico looking to pursue a career in
  the sciences.

The BMW Group has long been committed to educational initiatives at
  its various sites, and a million children and young people have
  already benefited. Its longstanding collaboration with the UNAOC
  primarily fosters grass-roots initiatives to develop their knowledge
  of STEM subjects (sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics),
  which are important foundations to careers in exactly the areas that
  enable participation in global growth.

In addition, the BMW Group will invite delegates at the conference to
  join an interactive workshop on the circular economy. Participants
  will learn more about how the principles of circularity can be
  integrated into business ideas to help save resources and
  CO

emissions.
