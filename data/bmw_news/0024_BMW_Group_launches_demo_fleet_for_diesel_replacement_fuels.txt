The BMW Group is using its
  presence at the "Fleet Europe Days" on 22 and 23 October in
  Luxembourg to show fleet operators ways to decarbonise their fleets.
  In addition to fully electrified vehicles, the focus will be on fuels
  based on renewable raw materials, so-called Carbon Neutral Fuels (CNF).

Their advantage: the potential to save CO

. With more than
  250 million existing vehicles in Europe, their CO

footprint can be improved if the proportion of renewable fuels is
  increased. A new technical solution used by the BMW Group is proof
  that all BMW diesels in a fleet are fuelled exclusively with HVO100.
  Refuelling data from the vehicle is compared with data from the fleet
  operator's payment system. This means that the fuel used by the
  vehicle can be traced seamlessly. An important step towards a
  "CNF only-fleet" for fleet customers.

Dr. Martin Kaufmann, Head of Powertrain Development at the BMW
  Group: "Our goal is always to have more environmentally friendly
  and efficient vehicles on the road. With the diesel replacement fuel
  HVO100, we have an opportunity to reduce the CO

footprint
  of vehicle fleets. Especially in the area of fuels that are not based
  on fossil fuels, we see a potential that we are ready to realise.”

Bernhard Kuhnt, Head of Sales Region Europe, BMW Group:
  "Fleet customers are extremely important for sales in Europe and
  at the same time diesel remains a very good powertrain technology for
  many fleets.

The use of HVO100 offers a way to quickly reduce CO

emissions that takes into account individual use cases - whether
  driving long distances or towing a trailer - and can thus help our
  fleet customers reduce their CO

footprint."

Initial contractual agreements with the operators of large BMW
  diesel fleets in Germany and Italy are imminent. These test fleets,
  together with the internal BMW Group fleet that has already been
  launched, will provide important data and findings for the further
  improvement of the technical solution.

Since January 2025, all diesel models produced in Germany are being
  fuelled with HVO100 before delivery to dealers. This step underlines
  BMW's commitment to making decarbonisation possible and achievable
  today. The abbreviation HVO stands for 'Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil'
  and the suffix '100' indicates that it is filled with 100 per cent
  pure fuel.

"Neste MY Renewable Diesel™" HVO100 is used at the
  BMW Group plants in Munich, Dingolfing, Regensburg and Leipzig.

The fuel from Finnish manufacturer Neste enables a CO2e reduction of
  up to 90 per cent ("well to wheel") compared to fossil
  diesel. The initial filling at the plants before delivery to the BMW
  Group dealer organisation is five to eight litres, depending on the model.

For the BMW Group, technological openness is a top priority.
  "Options instead of bans" is its motto. The company
  continues to invest in a broad portfolio - from battery electric
  vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cells to highly efficient
  combustion engines that can run on renewable fuels.

The BMW Group has long approved its vehicles for a variety of
  regenerative fuels: HVO according to EN15940 as well as B10 and eFuels
  according to EN590 for diesel engines. In addition, E20/25 and eFuels
  according to EN228 for petrol engines.

Regulation must catch up. To accelerate the uptake of renewable fuels
  across the market, the BMW Group is calling for an ambitious
  implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), including
  national quotas that require at least a 30% reduction in greenhouse
  gas emissions from fuels, to be transposed into national law by 2025.

Dr. Thomas Becker, Head of Policy, External Relations and
  Sustainability at the BMW Group, says: "The BMW Group demands
  that every measure to reduce CO

emissions is taken into
  account at every stage of a vehicle's life cycle. This also includes
  the use of renewable fuels - especially for vehicles that primarily
  run on CO

-neutral fuel (CNF). These must be formally
  recognised in EU fleet legislation. The fuels are available, what we
  need now is a pragmatic and quickly implementable regulation that
  enables companies to develop innovations and make them marketable."
