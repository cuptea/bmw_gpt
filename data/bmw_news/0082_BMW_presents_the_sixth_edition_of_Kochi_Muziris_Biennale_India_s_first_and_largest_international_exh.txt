Since its very first edition in 2012,
  BMW has been an official partner of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale (KMB).
  For the sixth Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the Kochi Biennale Foundation is
  curated by Nikhil Chopra with HH Art Spaces featuring 66 artists
  projects from more than 25 countries. The biennale opened to the
  public on 12 December 2025 and will last for a period of four months.

said, “The BMW Group India is proud to continue
  its partnership with the sixth edition of Kochi-Muziris Biennale, a
  platform that celebrates creativity, dialogue and new perspectives.
  Art has the power to inspire progressive thinking, and this
  partnership reflects our belief in innovation that moves both people
  and culture forward. The Biennale’s spirit of openness and exploration
  mirrors, BMWs philosophy of redefining possibility, and we are
  delighted to be a part of a movement that enriches India’s cultural landscape.”

The exhibition, the largest contemporary art biennale in South Asia
  and the first of its kind in India, unfolds across 29 venues in Fort
  Kochi, Mattancherry, Willingdon Islands and Ernakulam. It sits in
  conversation with a constellation of exhibitions, performances, and
  discursive programmes which are set in close dialogue with Kochi’s
  unique geographical, social and cultural ecology.

Embracing process as methodology, this edition places ‘friendship
  economies’ as the very scaffolding of the exhibition. The curatorial
  vision acknowledges bodies as a landscape of time, a vessel of labour,
  joy, and loss, and invites the visitors to think through ‘embodied
  histories’ of those that came before us and continue to live within us
  in the form of cells, stories and techniques.

Since its
  inception, BMW India has participated in leading cultural engagements
  across the country. In 2007, two BMW Art Cars created by world
  renowned artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were presented at
  the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai. BMW Art Cars by Andy Warhol, Jeff
  Koons, Sandro Chia and Cesar Manrique have been exclusively showcased
  at various editions of the India Art Fair. “The Future is Born of Art”
  is a unique initiative by BMW India and India Art Fair which aims to
  propel emerging Indian artists and further BMW Group’s commitment to
  promote art, sustainability, and innovation. In 2012-13, the
  innovative BMW Guggenheim Lab came to India. Based at Dr. Bhau Daji
  Lad Museum and conducted at six different sites in Mumbai, the lab
  organised six weeks of free programmes with diverse audiences and
  communities addressing the challenges and conditions of the urban city.

Since 2012, BMW has partnered with the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the
  contemporary art exhibition, which brings international artists to
  India and creates a global platform for Indian artists. This vital and
  dynamic partnership has been instrumental in shaping the Biennale into
  a global cultural landmark. BMW Group’s continued commitment, even in
  uncertain times, highlights its profound belief in the power of art
  and culture to unite and inspire.

Kochi-Muziris
  Biennale is India’s ﬁrst-ever biennial of international contemporary
  art and its story is unique to India’s current reality—its political,
  social and artistic landscape. It began as a government initiative,
  when the Department of Cultural Aﬀairs of the Government of Kerala
  approached two artists—Riyas Komu and Bose Krishnamachari—to help
  organize an international platform for art in India. The challenge was
  proportionate to the ambition of the project. A biennial had never
  gotten past the conceptual stage in India before. There was no
  existing infrastructure necessary for an exhibition of this scale—no
  spaces and no institutional support structures.

With the support of the government, private patrons, and local
  businesses the Biennale found spaces and opened them up for art. The
  Indian art community has been growing rapidly and is emerging onto the
  world stage, and the international arts community oﬀered their support
  in sending art and artists to participate in Kochi. Artists became the
  spokespersons and activists for the biennale.

Nikhil Chopra’s artistic
  practice interweaves live art, drawing, photography, sculpture and
  installations. His performances, largely improvised, dwell on identity
  and its construction, autobiography and authorship, the pose and

self-portraiture. Nikhil combines everyday life, memory and
  collective history; daily acts such as eating, resting, washing and
  dressing, in tandem with the act and discipline of making large-scale
  drawings in situ become the process of making an artwork.

Nikhil’s works have been included in major exhibitions including
  Documenta 14, the12th Sharjah Biennale, the 12th Havana Biennale; the
  2nd Kochi-Muziris Biennale and the 53rd Venice Biennale amongst
  others. He has also shown works and performed at the Gropius Bau,
  Berlin; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Science
  and Industry, Manchester; New Art Exchange, Nottingham; , SFMOMA, San
  Francisco; Artsonje, Seoul; Museum of Contemporary Art, Yinchuan,
  China; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Astrup Fearnley Museum, Oslo, Norway;
  Indian Highway, Serpentine Gallery, London, UK; Carriageworks, Sydney;
  and Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi.

Nikhil Chopra was born in Kolkata in 1974, and lives in Goa where he
  runs HH Art Spaces with partners. After studying at the Faculty of
  Fine Arts at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Vadodara, India, the
  artist continued his studies in the United States in 2003, returning
  to India in 2005 with a Master’s degree from Ohio State University.

HH Art Spaces, Goa, was
  founded in 2014 by Nikhil Chopra and Romain Loustau, both live art and
  performance artists. HH Art Spaces is a movement, and currently
  includes the shared vision, voices, rigor, and energies of a
  collective of artists and cultural practitioners. Key founding and
  partner members of the organization are: Madhavi Gore, Shivani Gupta,
  and Shaira Sequeira Shetty. HH Art Spaces fosters an ethos of
  collaborations, residencies and interdisciplinary exchanges within art
  and culture; and has worked with artists and organizations locally,
  regionally and internationally.

Over the years, HH Art Spaces has developed a rich archive of visual,
  sonic, installation, and live art and performance work, in South Asia.
  HH Art Spaces promotes artists and produces exhibitions and artist
  residencies, talks and workshops, in contemporary and traditional
  artistic practice-based research, bridging transdisciplinary practices
  through collaborations and partnerships. HH is a hub and a laboratory
  for artists and curators to investigate and explore new forms and
  approaches within arts and cultural practice.
