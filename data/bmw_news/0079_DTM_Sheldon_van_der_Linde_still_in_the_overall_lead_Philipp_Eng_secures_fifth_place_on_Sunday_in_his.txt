Summary:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The penultimate race weekend of the DTM season at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) may not have gone according to plan for Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), but he was able to stay in the overall lead nonetheless. The South African driver missed out on the points in both races, finishing eleventh twice, but still leads by eleven in the drivers’ championship ahead of the season finale in Hockenheim (GER) in two weeks.

After a disappointing qualifying session, van der Linde started
  Saturday’s race from 16th place, finishing just outside the points in
  eleventh position. However, he exceeded track limits too many times
  during his chasing performance, receiving a nine-place grid penalty
  for Sunday's race. This saw him starting 15th after reaching sixth
  place in qualifying. He then proceeded to spin on the wet surface on
  lap one, putting him dead last. He was able to catch up very quickly
  in the closing phase, by using slicks as the surface dried out, but
  eleventh place was the best he could do.

His Schubert team-mate Eng, who had finished twelfth on Saturday,
  produced a convincing performance in heavy rain to finish fifth in
  qualifying. He made a good start to the race and was on course for a
  podium finish for some time. However, his wet-weather tyres
  deteriorated too rapidly as the track dried out during the closing
  laps and he dropped back from third to fifth.

Marco Wittmann (GER) did not manage to reach the top ten in either
  race in his #11 BMW M4 GT3 from Walkenhorst Motorsport. He struggled
  due to the fact that he was unable to secure a good grid position in
  either qualifying session. The two-time DTM champion finished the
  races in 14th and 12th positions. He was in fifth place for a while on
  Sunday, but like Eng he then lost ground due to the wet-weather tyres
  on the final laps. Leon Köhler (GER) was at the wheel of the #10 BMW
  M4 GT3 this weekend, replacing the ill Esteban Muth (BEL). He
  performed very well on his debut in the BMW M4 GT3 and finished 13th
  on Sunday, right behind Wittmann. He retired from Saturday’s race
  after a good display.

The season finale in Hockenheim, where all the titles will be
  decided, will take place on 8th/9th October.

“We did not do a good job this weekend. My track
  limits penalty from Saturday knocked us back on Sunday, and then I
  made that error on lap one. The deficit was simply too large for us to
  finish in the points. However, all is not lost. I am still in the lead
  in the drivers’ championship. Now Hockenheim will be decisive and I
  really believe in my team and in myself - and I believe that we can do it.”

“We managed to turn things around well after some difficulties on
  Saturday. We coped really well with the very wet conditions on Sunday
  – it helped that we had done testing here and were well prepared. The
  race started superbly and I got to third place quickly. Once the
  circuit started to dry out slowly, I no longer had the pace that I
  needed to reach the podium in the end. It is disappointing that it
  didn't work out, as it would have been fantastic to be on the podium
  in my home race. However, the team did a good job.”

“Unfortunately, that was a weekend where nothing
  went right for us. That is extremely disappointing. If you don't hit
  the mark in qualifying and have to start all the way back there, it is
  just unbelievably difficult to make progress in the race. On Sunday,
  things were looking better for a while in fifth place but, to be
  honest, our strategy was all wrong. Going with wet-weather tyres
  finished us on those last laps, and slicks would have been the right
  choice for the closing phase. Things have been going wrong for the
  last three race weekends. We don’t get the luck during the races, but
  we have to be frank and admit that we are making strategic mistakes.
  With conditions like they were on Sunday, the right tactics can make a
  huge difference. Unfortunately, that didn’t work out. Now I am hoping
  to round off the season in a positive manner in Hockenheim.”

“Overall, that was a very positive weekend for me. When you consider
  that I took the wheel of the BMW M4 GT3 for the first time in Friday's
  practice session, I can be very pleased with that. It was my dream to
  drive in the DTM just once. So, I was speechless when I heard that
  Walkenhorst Motorsport was giving me this chance. I think I produced a
  good performance. Now we’ll see what the future brings.”
