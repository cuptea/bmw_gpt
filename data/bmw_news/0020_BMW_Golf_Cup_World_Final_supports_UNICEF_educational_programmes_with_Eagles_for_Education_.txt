+++ Zenith of the largest international tournament series for amateur
  golfers visits Bangkok (Thailand) for the first time +++ 36 nations
  represented at the Alpine Golf Club +++ “Eagles for Education” back at
  the BMW Golf Cup World Final +++ BMW Group donates €1,000 for each
  eagle to support UNICEF and the “BRIDGE” joint initiative +++

“Eagles for Education” has been the slogan of
  the BMW Group’s educational initiative in golf since 2023. The company
  makes use of numerous BMW title tournaments around the world to
  provide world-class sport and an impressive spectator experience,
  while also fulfilling its responsibility as a corporate citizen and
  participating in solutions to social challenges. At next week’s BMW
  Golf Cup World Final in Bangkok, the BMW Group will donate €1,000 to
  UNICEF* educational programmes for each net eagle recorded during the
  tournament. With Eagles for Education, the BMW Group supports the work
  of the UN International Children’s Fund UNICEF to provide young people
  with the skills and knowledge they require to enjoy success in the
  working world of tomorrow and chart their own path through life.

Tracing its origins back to 1982, the BMW Golf Cup is the largest
  international tournament series for amateur golfers. Each season sees
  national competitions taking place in more than 30 countries, with the
  winners receiving an invitation to the World Final. This provides the
  opportunity to experience a pro-standard international tournament,
  enjoy a fascinating support programme and evening events and meet
  golfing enthusiasts from around the world in a friendly environment.
  Next week, the World Final for the 2024 season will be held in
  Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, for the first time. The tournament
  at the exclusive Alpine Golf Club will feature players competing for
  the individual title in three categories (two for men, one for women)
  and battling for top spot in the team standings, which are determined
  by the (net) individual results. Participants will also be aiming to
  support a good cause with their sporting achievements as they attempt
  to surpass the total of € 49,000 recorded for “Eagles for Education”
  at last year’s World Final.

Eagles for Education is part of a collaboration between the BMW Group
  and UNICEF, under the slogan “BRIDGE. Educating young people for
  tomorrow, today”. The focus of the collaboration is to bridge learning
  gaps within society and create learning and education opportunities in
  science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) – because STEM
  professions are particularly important given that they are the engine
  of global economic growth.

A lack of qualifications is already leading to a worldwide shortage
  of expertise. Millions of jobs are expected to go unfilled in the
  future. Studies show that the problem is particularly acute in low and
  middle-income countries and affects girls and women more frequently.
  Nowadays, females remain the minority in STEM education and
  professions. Together, UNICEF and the BMW Group are working to reduce
  the growing inequality in global education.

The list of countries where the BMW Group and UNICEF are working
  together includes South Africa (venue for the BMW Golf Cup World Final
  last year), Brazil, India, Mexico and Thailand – all countries which
  have BMW Group presence. At this year's World Final in Thailand,
  “Eagles for Education” will therefore continue to follow the principle
  of social commitment to which the company has dedicated itself: think
  global, act local.
