The triad of world-class golf, sheer driving
  pleasure, and a dash of Bavarian zest in Germany since 1989 has been
  named the BMW International Open. The tournament has long been an
  institution on the DP World Tour; no other event has been
  collaborating with the same title partner without interruption for as
  long. The 37th edition of the BMW International Open will take place
  between 1st and 5th July 2026 (Golfclub München Eichenried). Three of
  Germany’s top players – Stephan Jäger, Matti Schmid and two-time Major
  winner Martin Kaymer – have already confirmed their participation,
  with further national and international stars set to follow. Tickets
  for what is currently the only German stop on the DP World Tour
  calendar are available from the official ticket shop, and you can take
  advantage of a ten percent Christmas discount until 24th December 2025:

The last time that Stephan Jäger teed off at his home club was in
  2021. The 36-year-old has been living in the USA with his family for
  many years and has made a name for himself on the PGA TOUR. Jäger had
  intended to return to the place where he grew up and learned to play
  golf to take part in this year’s BMW International Open. However, a
  joyous occasion in July 2025 prevented him from returning home as
  Jäger’s second son entered the world. Now there is nothing stopping
  him from competing next summer. The winner of the 2024 Texas
  Children's Houston Open said: “I’m really looking forward to finally
  playing at Eichenried again and enjoying the BMW International Open.
  Having a tournament like this in your hometown is a rare and lucky
  coincidence. I can’t wait to enjoy this week with my family as well as
  old friends and colleagues in front of a German crowd.”

Two-time Major winner Martin Kaymer is another golfer not wanting to
  miss out on this experience, and he enjoys a special connection with
  the BMW International Open. The 40-year-old currently holds two
  tournament records: he is the only German winner and the youngest
  champion. Kaymer was 23 years and 177 days old when he won in Munich
  in 2008, but that is not the only reason that the event is one of his
  favourite tournaments. He said: “The people that you work alongside
  make a huge difference. You can tell that everyone at BMW is
  incredibly passionate about the tournament. Which makes it enjoyable
  for us as players, and I’m always grateful that we have a fantastic
  event like this here in Germany. Coming here is a source of great joy.”

It is this joy that Matti Schmid also associates with the BMW
  International Open. The Bavarian golfer, who predominantly plays on
  the PGA TOUR in the USA, has the iconic German tournament marked as a
  highlight on his calendar every year. As a child, the now 28-year-old
  watched the pros at Golfclub München Eichenried with great enthusiasm,
  and now the next generation of golfers are looking up to him: Schmid
  is currently the best-placed German golfer in the world rankings. At
  the 2025 BMW International Open he was the best home-grown player,
  finishing in joint seventh, and he cannot wait for the next edition:
  “The atmosphere was incredible throughout the week. I hope that
  everyone will be coming back because it’s great when we have a full
  house here.”

The Christmas promotional discount applies to day tickets and
  tournament tickets, as well as to Fairway Club tickets – excluding
  tickets that have already been discounted such as those for young
  people, students or people with disabilities. The ticket price
  includes a free shuttle bus service between Ismaning station and the
  golf club from Thursday to Sunday, and free car parking at the
  tournament site, subject to availability. There is no general
  admission fee for the Pro-Am tournament (Wednesday 1st July 2026).
  Children up to and including 14 years of age also enjoy free entry on
  all days.

New for the 2026 BMW International Open, an after-work ticket will be
  available for the Thursday or Friday. It will be valid as of 15:00 and
  can be purchased for half the cost of a day ticket. For information
