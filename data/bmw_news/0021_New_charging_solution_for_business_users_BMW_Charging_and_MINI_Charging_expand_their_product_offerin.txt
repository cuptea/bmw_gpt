BMW Charging and MINI Charging have partnered
  with Digital Charging Solutions GmbH (DCS) to present an innovative
  fleet application that greatly simplifies the monitoring and
  centralised billing of vehicle charging for companies.

This solution links the charging accounts of the fleet vehicles
  with a central company account. Charging for each driver is
  automatically invoiced and consolidated into one payment for the
  company. Fleet drivers can take advantage of the same features,
  tariffs and brand experiences as private customers.

The introduction of this new fleet solution from BMW Charging
  and MINI Charging marks another milestone in the electrification of
  corporate fleets. Specially designed for small and medium-sized
  companies with up to 50 electric vehicles, it provides an efficient
  and user-friendly charging solution – and features a central overview
  that shows all charging sessions and combines them into a single
  invoice. Businesses benefit from a solution with no setup costs that
  offers automatic reimbursement for fleet drivers.

Implementing the fleet solution is quick and straightforward.
  First, fleet managers create a company account with CHARGE NOW to
  register their company. Then fleet drivers create a business customer
  account including a charging contract with BMW Charging or MINI
  Charging and activate the option for bill payment by the company.
  Finally, the fleet manager links the driver accounts to the company
  account, enabling centralized and automated billing.

This solution optimises charging cost management for electric
  fleets, reduces the administrative workload and improves cost
  transparency.

Fleet managers benefit from consolidated invoicing for all
  charging sessions as well as a central dashboard for monitoring up to
  50 vehicles from different brands.

Fleet drivers, meanwhile, enjoy a consistent user experience
  offering the same functions (e.g. Plug & Charge), tariffs and
  brand experiences provided for private customers – thanks to seamless
  integration in the vehicle and the My BMW App or MINI App.

Once activated, charging sessions are automatically paid by the
  company, without any need for private advance payments or manual refunds.

The solution was launched in August of this year in eleven
  European markets: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg,
  Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and the United
  Kingdom. They were followed in September by Sweden, Norway, Poland,
  Czechia, Denmark, Slovakia, Hungary and Finland.
