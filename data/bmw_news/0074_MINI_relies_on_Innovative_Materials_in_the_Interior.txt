MINI remains true to its claim: “Less is
    more”, focusing on what really matters. With this approach, MINI
    makes an important contribution to shaping the future in a more
    conscious and sustainable way. This commitment is particularly
    reflected in the current MINI generation, for example through the
    use of innovative and recycled materials in the interior.

In line with the "Secondary First" principle, MINI uses
    knit from recycled materials in all models starting with the market
    launch in 2024. The knitted material consists of 92% polyester
    recyclate and is used for dashboard upholstery, door trim, and
    center console lid. This significantly reduces CO2e emissions and
    water consumption in production compared to primary materials.

The specially developed knitted look gives the interior of the MINI
    family a distinctive look and opens up new possibilities for
    individual colour and pattern worlds. It enables a two-colour design
    with an impressive depth effect. This effect occurs when the colour
    of the lower textile layer subtly shines through the upper layer.
    This structure, inspired by sneaker design and carefully further
    developed, gives the surfaces visual complexity and ensures a
    high-quality, unique look in the interior. The components are also
    abrasion-resistant, structurally reinforced, and completely
    leather-free.

The new BMW iX3 also relies on this innovative technology: In the
    "Contemporary" trim of the first model of the Neue Klasse,
    the knit of the instrument panel is made of 75% recycled material –
    a clear commitment to the principle of "Design for
    Circularity". While the light in the MINI family is projected
    onto the dashboard, the lighting in the BMW iX3 comes from the rear.
    For this, the knit pattern was deliberately designed to be more
    translucent so that the new backlighting comes into its own
    optimally.

The textile solution for the MINI interior was made ready for
    series production in close collaboration with internal and external
    partners: cross-industry and cross-departmental cooperation proves
    to be the key to innovations in sustainability. Close cooperation
    with partners generates new impulses and solutions that further
    advance sustainable materials and processes and enable the
    development of future-oriented products.

This innovative strength was recently honoured: MINI Knit is the
    overall winner of the SPE Automotive Award 2025 and winner of the
    Grand Award in the "Body Interior" category. The award is
    one of the most prestigious honors in the plastics industry. The
    Grand Award is presented for the best submission across all
    categories.
