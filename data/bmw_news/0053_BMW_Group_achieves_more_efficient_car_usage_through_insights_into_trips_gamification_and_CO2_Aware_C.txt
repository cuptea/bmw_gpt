Our initiatives in collaboration with cities include mobility
  research and piloting solutions, making driving and traffic more
  efficient, while reducing congestion. Mobility behavior is an
  important aspect for cities, especially regarding driving and parking
  vehicles in urban areas. That is why we research how to make the
  mobility behavior of our customers more city-friendly, tailored to
  their individual needs. Through strategic collaborations, such as with
  the city of Rotterdam, both parties gain deep insights into what the
  city needs, and which solutions work well with drivers. Our research
  shows that mobility behavior can be effectively influenced by nudging,
  or in other words, the positive motivation of people.

Through attractive digital experiences, we aim to enhance the driving
  experience and encourage our customers to use their vehicles more
  efficiently. Recently, three pilots based on relatively small but
  positive incentives have been completed. The insights from these are promising.

The research project named “My Travels”, conducted throughout the
  Netherlands in the second half of 2024 with BMW models, provided a
  report to users about the length of their trips made and offered
  information on realistic alternatives such as travel by foot, bicycle,
  or public transport. The results showed that simply gaining insight
  into one's own travel behavior, including information on the length of
  trips and alternative travel options, provides incentives to choose an
  alternative mode of transport instead of the car. This result aligns
  perfectly with Rotterdam's goal to free up roads for those who truly
  need to use them.

Additionally, we implemented a pilot with a gamification approach to
  reduce the footprint of our products in the use phase. Real world data
  from a representative BMW and MINI fully electric fleet show that
  driving in the efficient driving mode generally results in an average
  energy consumption reduction of about 7%. The “MINI Artwork Challenge”
  pilot’s aim was to stimulate drivers to switch to this mode. It was
  conducted in the first quarter of this year in the latest generation
  fully electric MINI models Countryman and Cooper, exploring whether
  gamification can encourage more energy-efficient driving behavior. In
  this pilot, the virtual artwork – an AI generated image — grew larger
  the more the user drove in the efficient driving mode. The pilot
  results show this encouraged participants to increase their share of
  trips in the efficient driving mode by 60% compared to the baseline phase.

Finally, the research project “COOL” (CO

Optimal
  Charging) was a field experiment that started in April 2025. Its goal
  was to provide plug-in hybrid and EV drivers with insights into
  charging behavior and the associated CO

emissions. By
  using a simple and insightful app that shows CO₂ emissions per kWh of
  the local electricity mix in real time and alerts the user when they
  drop below a certain value, we support drivers in deciding when to
  charge their vehicles.

In total, 355 drivers of electric and plug-in hybrid BMW models
  participated in this project, which brought at least two valuable
  results. Gamification increased CO₂-improved EV charging by 6% and it
  suggests that even participants who are already environmentally
  conscious are still willing to take additional steps to reduce their
    CO

impact by charging their vehicles CO

improved.

The city of Rotterdam and BMW Group will use the insights gained to
  develop more sustainable, user-oriented mobility concepts that improve
  both individual mobility and the urban mobility ecosystem.

This research project originated from a bachelor thesis supervised by
  the University of Münster. Erasmus University Rotterdam was involved
  as the regular research partner of BMW Netherlands in the design and
  analysis of the feedback survey.

Three hundred participants, drivers of BMW and MINI models across the
  country, were provided with a test app that offered a clear view of
  travel habits, at a more detailed level than the “My Trips” feature
  already known to BMW and MINI customers from the My BMW and MINI app.

The app contains two elements: Distances and Alternatives. The first
  offered the driver transparency of their car trips. A pie chart
  allowed app users to see at a glance how many trips they made weekly
  of up to 1 kilometer, 1-5 kilometers, and 5 kilometers or more.
  Alternatives provided insight into which realistic alternatives would
  have been possible for specific trips: by foot, bicycle, or public
  transport, including any distance and/or time savings.

The research question was: do active app users reduce more trips
  based on the travel report and recommendations for alternative modes
  of transport than inactive users?

Overall, analysis indicated that active users of the app reduced one
  car trip weekly compared to participants who did not use the app. This
  means that simply gaining insight into one's own travel behavior and
  information on alternative travel options provides incentives to leave
  the car unused once a week, potentially reducing traffic congestion in
  the city.

Zooming in on weekly trips, the reduction in car usage was even
  slightly larger: active users made an average of 1.5 fewer trips (of
  up to five kilometers). In other words, more than one short trip was
  avoided. No significant decrease in car usage was seen on weekends.

Factors influencing participants' choices related to timing (weekday
  or weekend), weather conditions, and personal situation (with or
  without children). This emerged from the comprehensive survey that was
  part of the research. When asked which types of trips participants
  were most inclined to swap for alternative transport, the top three
  were: 1) to a park, restaurant, etc., 2) to the gym, 3) to the
  supermarket. Picking up and dropping off children remains preferred by
  car, as indicated by the last place in the ranking.

When asked about the three main reasons to leave the car unused, the
  top three were: 1) travel duration, 2) convenience and availability of
  alternative modes of transport, 3) weather conditions.

This pilot resulted from a graduation project within the BMW Group's
  development department, which designs (product) solutions in the field
  of energy and sustainable/urban mobility, part of the “Connected
  Company”. An overarching goal of many of their projects is to promote
  efficient driving habits to support potential reductions of CO

emissions in the use phase. The “MINI Artwork Challenge” aimed
  to "achieve a lasting change in driving behavior through artistic incentives”.

130 participants took part in the pilot. These drivers were rewarded
  for using the efficient driving mode of their MINIs. The more
  frequently this mode was used, the further an AI-generated artwork
  (consisting of stylized plants or animals) evolved. The image was then
  displayed on the central screen at the start of each trip.

Real world data from a representative BMW and MINI fully electric
  fleet show that driving in the efficient driving mode generally
  results in an average energy consumption reduction of about 7%. The
  “MINI Artwork Challenge” encouraged participants to increase their
  share of trips in the efficient driving mode to almost 40%, compared
  to 25% in the baseline phase. This corresponds to a 60% increase in
  trips in the efficient driving mode.

We saw there are still some gaps to address in the field of smart
  charging. Currently, smart charging enables cost-efficient charging
  only at home, but optimal charging technologies are not yet widely
  available in the electric vehicle market. Additionally, there is a
  lack of awareness about the impact of charging behavior on the
    CO

footprint of an electric car. While price-optimized
  charging is available for dynamic charging tariffs, it often lacks
  optimization aimed at reducing CO

emissions.

Our idea was to provide clear CO

information about the
  country’s electricity mix to users, enabling them to shift their
  charging to timeslots that are better in terms of CO

emissions over a longer cycle. By applying the nudge concept, we
  aimed to encourage and steer beneficial charging behavior. Ultimately,
  this approach should contribute to reducing the CO

footprint in both public and private spaces.

The research question was: how can nudges effectively influence the
  timing of electric vehicle charging to align with periods in which the
  use of renewable energy sources is higher?

The pilot project, conducted from April to July 2025, involved BMW
  355 electric vehicle drivers in the Netherlands. A digital charging
  feature called “COOL” was made available in Dutch and English through
  the 360° Mobility app on iOS. This simple and insightful app showed
  the CO

emissions per kWh of electricity in real-time and
  alerting the user when it dropped below a certain value. Charging and
  vehicle data from all registered participants were collected on BMW
  Labs. Additionally, qualitative interviews were conducted with 14
  participants to gather in-depth insights.

A total of 13.153 charging sessions were analyzed, and timeslots with
  a cleaner energy mix were identified on 67 out of 87 days. Through
  gamification, we successfully encouraged participants to shift their
  charging sessions to time slots with a forecasted higher share of
  renewables in the Dutch energy mix, achieving a 6% increase in such
  charging sessions compared to the control group. In contrast,
  providing forecasts and statistics alone had no significant effect.
  Plug-in hybrid drivers were less likely to change their charging
  behavior. Customers expressed three things:

The post pilot survey with 90 participants also revealed a valuable
  insight. When asked if the participant ‘would be willing to make an
  extra effort to charge with reduced CO

emissions, such as
  by setting a charging window in their app’, 73% of participants
  answered “yes”.  Notably, 62% of these environmentally motivated
  participants already have a green electricity contract. This indicates
  that even those who are already committed to sustainable energy use
  are open to taking additional steps to further reduce their CO

impact through charging in low-emission windows.

In 2022, Rotterdam and BMW launched the Smart City Travel pilot. This
  project focused on motorists who (regularly) drove from outside toward
  the inner city of Rotterdam. BMW Group, Rotterdam, and the Erasmus
  University Rotterdam investigated ways to entice motorists to park
  their cars at a park-and-ride (P+R) on the outskirts of the city and
  continue the last mile of their journeys using public or shared
  transport. The question was: what is needed to motivate BMW drivers to
  make this choice in advance and then actually switch modes when an
  alternative mode is actively offered in the navigation?

Results showed that information about alternative transport should
  not only arrive in the car after the trip starts, as people are not
  prepared for it or, for practical reasons (no coat, too many
  belongings), cannot or do not want to switch. This led to the idea of
  focusing more on transparency and providing drivers with insight into
  their trips and offering alternatives as desired (before or after a
  trip) in an app.

A safe, healthy, and livable city is high on the agenda of the
  Rotterdam municipality. This requires a new vision of future mobility,
  where sustainability, traffic safety, accessibility, and flow play a
  crucial role. Since 2018, BMW Group and the City of Rotterdam have
  been working together to realize these shared ambitions and pilot
  mobility solutions around integrating the car into the ecosystem of a
  livable city.
