BMW Group Plant Munich is ready for the
  production of the next vehicle generation. The manufacturing equipment
  has been installed in the new body shop and assembly line, and
  functional checks have been successfully completed. During this
  so-called "Common Function Test," every system undergoes dry
  runs, in which production planners and plant technicians put the
  machinery through its paces. All production steps are executed without
  any parts in the system. Cycle by cycle, an invisible vehicle takes
  shape. Although no actual car is produced, this process provides the
  certainty that everything operates seamlessly and as planned.

Peter Weber, head of BMW Group Plant Munich, is delighted: “Just in
  time for the holidays, we have reached an important milestone: All
  manufacturing technologies and equipment are ready to go, and we are
  already training our associates for production of the BMW i3. We are
  taking major strides towards production of first pre-series vehicles,
  which will then come completely from our plant.”

However, plant employees will have to remain patient a little longer
  until then. BMW i3 assembly, which has so far been carried out at the
  nearby Research and Innovation Centre, will be relocating to Plant
  Munich in January. With this move, all technologies at Plant Munich
  are then in place to continue rigorous testing of the complete
  production system. Series production of the new BMW i3 will then ramp
  up in summer 2026.

Plant Munich is consistently aligned with the guiding principles of
  the BMW iFACTORY. Both the new body shop and new assembly line were
  digitally planned and built from the outset. Existing installations in
  the press shop and paint shop are also integrated into the BMW Group’s
  Virtual Factory. This made it possible to conduct functional testing
  of all technologies for the new vehicle generation virtually and well
  in advance.

In just 18 months, about a third of the plant grounds has undergone
  extensive remodelling. Old halls were dismantled, and a new assembly,
  logistics centre and body shop were built – all while still
  manufacturing up to 1,000 BMW 3 Series and 4 Series vehicles per day.
  Series production of the new BMW i3 is scheduled to begin in the
  second half of 2026.
