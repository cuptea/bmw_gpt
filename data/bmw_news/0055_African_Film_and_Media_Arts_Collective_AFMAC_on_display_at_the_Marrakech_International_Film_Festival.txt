is set to arrive in Marrakech
  following the successful completion of its first workshops with
  African filmmakers and visual artists in Lagos, Tangier, and Nairobi.
  Continuing her BMW Art Car project, the AFMAC initiative was launched
  in April this year by internationally renowned artist Julie Mehretu,
  in collaboration with Emmy-nominated film producer Mehret Mandefro and
  BMW. As the long-term mobility partner of the Marrakech International
  Film Festival (28 November – 6 December), Smeia, the exclusive
  importer of BMW in Morocco, together with BMW AG, will offer insights
  into works from AFMAC lead artists Zeresenay Berhane Mehari, Wanuri
  Kahiu, Jim Chuchu and The Otolith Group, as well as impressions from
  the workshops next to Mehretu’s

on the
  festival grounds during the opening weekend.

Established in 2001, the

aims to support and promote
  both the art of cinema and the film industry in Morocco. Smeia, the
  official BMW importer in Morocco, has been the mobility partner of the
  Marrakech International Film Festival for the past ten years enhancing
  each guest’s journey with elegance and distinction. Over the last two
  decades, the festival has evolved into a vibrant platform for
  creativity and exploration, celebrating the values of diversity,
  cultural exchange, and mutual enrichment.

For its 22

edition the Marrakech International Film
  Festival celebrates world cinema with a selection of 82 films from 31
  countries, presented in several sections: the Official Competition,
  Gala Screenings, Horizons section, the 11th Continent, Moroccan
  Panorama, Young Audiences and Families, and films screened in parallel
  with Tributes given to film personalities. The Official Competition
  showcases new talent in world cinema with 14 first and second feature
  films that compete for the Étoile d’or, awarded by a jury headed this
  year by South Korean director and multiple award winner Bong Joon-ho.
  Additionally, the festival will honour Jodie Foster, Guillermo del
  Toro, Raouya, and Hussein Fahmi – four exceptional figures whose
  careers showcase the diversity and richness of cinema. Highlights of
  this year's festival programme include screenings of film productions
  such as

  and Akinola Davies Jr.'s

Smeia, BMW and AFMAC are also collaborating with the festival’s

, an industry and talent development
  programme. As part of this partnership, Mehret Mandefro and Zeresenay
  Berhane Mehari will share insights into their work with the Atlas
  Station participants on 30 November at 12noon. The panel “Beyond the
  Gaze: Authentic African Stories and the Creative Journey” explores the
  promise and perils of authentic storytelling as part of the creative
  process building AFMAC. Zeresenay Berhane Mehari will talk about his
  creative process and explore how to protect voice and vision in a
  global marketplace that often requires compromise.

At this year’s festival edition, Julie
  Mehretu's BMW Art Car #20 will be showcased on the festival grounds,

in 2024, marking the first time in the collection's
  history that an artist developed an Art Car that goes far beyond the
  car as a pure art object. In collaboration with BMW and Mehret
  Mandefro, Mehretu launched the African Film and Media Arts Collective
  (AFMAC), which has been hosting workshops in 2025 and 2026 across
  African cities such as Dakar, Lagos, and Cape Town. The initiative
  aims to nurture creativity and foster collaboration with emerging
  African artists and filmmakers.

“The magic of bringing people together starts with us. AFMAC creates
  forums for conversations in small, critical masses and surfaces
  resources to take the next steps. We build on the work of our local
  cultural partners: They already created a grounded cultural
  infrastructure, showing that art is not just a nice-to-have but a
  must-have. The talent and cultural energy emerging from these cities
  is electric – culture cannot be gated, it will always find a way to be
  heard,“ says

, co-founder of AFMAC.

The outcomes of the AFMAC workshops will be exhibited alongside the
  20th BMW Art Car at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz
  MOCAA) in Cape Town at the end of 2026. The presentation at the
  Marrakech International Film Festival offers a unique opportunity to
  gain first insights into the ongoing project ahead of the final
  exhibition. The display of Mehretu’s BMW M Hybrid V8 in Marrakech is
  part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, celebrating the 50th anniversary
  of the legendary BMW Art Car Collection this year. To mark this
  jubilee, the tour features an exhibition programme spanning all five
  continents and including numerous accompanying events.

The AFMAC hub on the festival grounds in Marrakech is open to all
  visitors and located some meters away from the epicentre of the Film
  Festival Masterclasses, the Meydene theatre at

(2015), a single-channel
  video work, portrays an African body navigating tradition,
  expectation, and self-determination, using ritualistic movement and
  visual metaphors to transform constraint into liberation.

(2025) is a rhythmic visual
  meditation using aerial perspectives and editing to explore Earth's
  landscapes, cities, human activity, and environmental alteration,
  reflecting on the planet's ability to sustain human impact.

Through the trailer to the Sci-Fi
  short film

(2009) visitors encounter a
  futuristic Africa, 35 years after World War III ‘The Water War’. In a
  world where nature is extinct and the outside is dead, museum curator
  Asha defies the Maitu Council's restrictions to plant a germinating
  seedling outside, hoping to uncover signs of life.

Inspired by the poet Rabindranath Tagore's 1921
  lecture

at Berlin's
  Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität—recorded on shellac at the Hotel
  Esplanade—the Otolith Group's eponymous work bridges nearly a century
  of time. The digitized recording of Tagore's voice, which envisioned
  the world campus he would establish that same year at Visva Bharati
  University in West Bengal, now speaks to ancient Banyan trees and
  today's students. Through separate paths of image and sound, the work
  connects the ancient past to the distant future of a changing planet.

Through the trailer to
  the feature film

visitors encounter the
  story of a young Ethiopian girl and a lawyer who challenge
  deeply-rooted cultural traditions to fight for equal rights. When
  14-year-old Hirut is abducted for marriage and kills her captor in
  self-defense, lawyer Meaza steps in to save her from a death sentence,
  risking everything to confront one of Ethiopia’s oldest traditions.
