With the publication of its
  Environmental Impact Statement 2024, all BMW Group operations in
  Parsdorf are now part of the European environmental register, EMAS. In
  addition to the BMW Group Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC)
  and test-parts logistics, the pilot plant for high-voltage batteries
  in Parsdorf has been included in the environmental impact statement
  and EMAS registration for the first time. EMAS stands for the
  “Eco-Management and Audit Scheme”, which claims to be the most
  stringent environmental management system in the world. “We are very
  pleased with the EMAS registration of all our operations in Parsdorf,
  which underlines that our processes operate at a very high level –
  both economically and environmentally,” says Hansjörg Schilp, director
  of the CMCC and pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf.
  “The entire team has done an outstanding job.”

To be listed in the EMAS Register, companies must fulfil strict
  requirements and adhere to rigorous environmental standards. EMAS is a
  globally recognised framework that enables organisations to manage and
  continuously improve their environmental impact. A key element of the
  EMAS environmental management system is the international
  environmental management standard ISO 14001. EMAS also focuses on
  measurable improvements, transparency and legal certainty. Auditing
  aims to support companies in continuously improving their
  environmental performance – for example, by using energy and material
  more efficiently and reducing emissions, wastewater and waste from
  their sites. Beyond these direct environmental impacts, EMAS also
  addresses and evaluates indirect aspects, including the sustainability
  of products, procurement and supply chains, contractor practices and
  the environmental impact of employees commuting to work. (Source:

The validated environmental impact statement and the resulting
  inclusion in the EMAS Register by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry
  (IHK) for Munich and Upper Bavaria underscore the rigorous
  environmental standards upheld by the BMW Group in Parsdorf. Battery
  cell production at the CMCC, one of the three Parsdorf facilities, is
  powered entirely by electricity from 100% renewable energy sources.
  Hot water for process ventilation is generated using waste heat
  recovered from various primary processes, and all three Parsdorf
  facilities utilise heat pumps in their operations. “On our pilot lines
  for battery cells and high-voltage batteries, we are focusing on
  reducing the use of critical raw materials and energy, avoiding
  solvents and developing innovative circular economy approaches,”
  explains Schilp. Raw materials represent a significant cost factor for
  battery cells and high-voltage batteries. Efficient and responsible
  use of these resources is therefore necessary and also makes economic
  sense. The BMW Group is gaining valuable insights in this area in
  Parsdorf. Residual materials from the production process are collected
  and, wherever technically feasible, reintegrated into the
  value-creation cycle at the BMW Group’s Competence Centres through
  direct recycling. This innovative procedure enables residual materials
  from battery cell production, as well as whole battery cells, to be
  mechanically dismantled into their components.

The environmental impact statement for the BMW Group’s Parsdorf 
  operations (CMCC, pilot plant for high-voltage batteries and
  test-parts logistics) has been independently reviewed by TÜV SÜD
  Umweltgutachter GmbH and is now available online at:

Cell manufacturing at the CMCC in Parsdorf begins with electrode
  production: Here, the base material, comprising, for example, graphite
  for the anode and nickel oxides for the cathode, with binders and
  solvents, is metered and mixed in a precisely measured ratio. This
  creates the so-called “slurry” – which means wafer-thin metal foils
  are coated and then compressed after drying. In technical jargon, this
  is referred to as “calendering”. The highest level of precision is
  required: The foil is just a few micrometres thick – in other words,
  thinner than the threads of a spider web – while the coating is in the
  micrometre range. During cell assembly, the coated foils, referred to
  in the jargon as calendered electrodes, are coiled into so-called
  “jelly rolls” using the separator and inserted into the cell housing.
  The cells are filled with electrolyte, then charged for the first time
  and finally checked for functionality and quality.

Parsdorf is also home to the BMW Group’s largest pilot plant for Gen6
  high-voltage batteries, where production processes are developed and
  tested before large-scale production begins at the series plants in
  Debrecen (Hungary), Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Shenyang
  (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA). More than 350
  employees have been building initial high-voltage battery prototypes
  here since 2023. In the meantime, these batteries have also been
  delivered to the vehicle plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where they were
  installed in test vehicles for the Neue Klasse. For series production,
  the BMW Group sources battery cells for its high-voltage batteries
  from leading cell manufacturers, who produce the cells to the
  company's specifications. The highest technical standards apply. Upon
  receipt of goods, additional measurements – such as voltage checks –
  are carried out. Next comes cell clustering, where the battery cells
  are connected to coolers. This step ensures optimal insulation and
  cooling of the cells. The cell clusters and cell contact system are
  then laser-cleaned and welded with pinpoint precision. The in-line
  inspection continuously monitors each weld seam in real time. An
  innovative foaming process follows, ensuring that all elements are
  protected as a mechanical unit. The foam thus guarantees the safety,
  stability and durability of the high-voltage battery. The housing is
  then closed, sealed and riveted. In the final assembly step, the
  Energy Master – the central control unit – is installed onto the
  high-voltage battery. A permanently elastic sealing adhesive is
  applied to ensure a reliable seal. Finally, each high-voltage battery
  undergoes a 100% end-of-line inspection to ensure quality, safety and function.
