The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team secured pole position with a
  new lap record and the three BMW Motorrad factory riders and the team
  proceeded to do an outstanding job throughout the 24 hours of racing.
  Some problems with the electronics did knock the team back during the
  night. However, Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Guarnoni worked their way
  back up through the standings to reach the podium positions.
  Mikhalchik also claimed the fastest race lap, posting a time of
  1:52.898 minutes with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR.

The 2023 season started with third place at the 24 Hours of Le Mans
  (FRA) for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team and the #37 BMW M 1000
  RR. They followed this up with third place and another podium at the
  24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). At the 8-hour race at Suzuka, the
  team secured an outstanding sixth place with the best performance of
  any European team. The team featuring Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and
  Guarnoni reached the rostrum again to round off the season – both in
  the Bol d’Or and in the world championship.

The team at Le Castellet featured BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory rider
  Loris Baz (FRA), competing as the fourth rider for the BMW Motorrad
  World Endurance Team in the finale, as well as in the practice
  sessions and during qualifying.

The Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team had secured pole position in the
  Superstock class with the #9 BMW M 1000 RR. As injuries prevented Jan
  Bühn (GER) and Nelson Major (FRA) from competing in the race, Baz was
  able to join the team at short notice as the third rider alongside
  Kenny Foray and Loïc Arbel (FRA). However, the team that had
  celebrated a hard-earned victory at the season-opener at Le Mans (FRA)
  now experienced just how cruel endurance racing can be. The team was
  forced to retire in the early stages of the race due to a technical failure.

Three privateer BMW teams were also racing at Le Castellet. The Team
  LRP Poland claimed eleventh place overall with the #90 BMW S 1000 RR
  and seventh place in the Formula EWC class. The Japanese TONE RT
  SYNCEDGE 4413 BMW team crossed the finish line in 22th position
  overall (eleventh place in the Superstock class). The French Seigneur
  Motorsport Team Mont Blanc team finished the 24 hours in 30th place
  (19th place in the Superstock class).

“We
  had prepared really well and our pace was great ahead of this race. We
  were very competitive in all the practice sessions and we also secured
  pole position, scoring our first five points in the process. We were
  38 points behind and we still felt we had a good chance as there were
  85 points up for grabs. We needed to win this race, and hope that the
  others endured some bad luck. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite manage
  it. During the night, we twice had a very similar problem with the
  power supply in the motorbike. That cost us about eight laps in total,
  which in turn definitely cost us second place and had an effect on the
  race for the world championship title. It is hard to take when there’s
  just one point in it. I would like to congratulate Yamaha on the world
  championship title and Suzuki on winning the race here. Nonetheless,
  we were able to show the pace we have and I am very pleased that we
  finished all four races this year, including three podiums in the
  24-hour races. That was unthinkable last year and shows what potential
  we have. I would like to thank the entire BMW Motorrad World Endurance
  Team, our great riders and everyone in Munich and Berlin who made this
  possible. We now have a long winter ahead of us. We need to continue
  to improve and I am sure that we when we return, we will be well
  equipped to challenge for the title.”

“I have mixed feelings. To be honest, if you had told me
  about that result before the season, I would have been quite happy.
  But now we feel that the title was also possible and then you want
  more. But this is a particular race and I think we have been strong.
  In qualifying, we showed our potential by taking pole position. The
  riders again did a tremendous job. In the race, we had some bad luck
  and some technical issues that cost us several laps. If we could have
  won maybe the world title would also been possible. That means that we
  have some work to do and the title will be our goal for next year.
  Thanks to BMW, to the riders and the entire team for their hard and
  great work this season. There are so many people who have contributed
  to the fact that we finished all races and been on the podium in all
  24-hour races. Next year we will attack again!“

“I am certainly feeling very
  happy. That was a tumultuous race here. We made a different tactical
  choice and maybe we had some bad luck with the safety car. But the two
  defects also cost us some time. However, we always managed to come
  back. I think that was my best race performance. I was able to really
  push in each stint, catching up on the bikes ahead, posting
  consistently fast lap times and keeping pace with the fastest racers.
  I completed the final two stints. I had been feeling good up to that
  point, but the last one was really tough. We gave it everything as we
  were still aiming to finish second and secure second place in the
  world championship. However, it wasn’t possible as the gap was just
  too large. I am still very pleased nonetheless. We completed every
  race and it looks like we have solved the problems that we had last
  year. And I think that if we continue to improve a bit, we can be
  challenging for the world championship title next year. Thanks to
  everyone at BMW Motorrad Motorsport and in the team, who all worked so
  hard. I think that we can be proud of what we have achieved, and we
  will manage to take the next step.”

“It’s like having mixed emotions. On
  one side, I am really happy, for sure. On the other side we missed the
  world championship title just narrowly and had some bad luck during
  the races. But I am happy that we all made big steps since last year,
  with the bike, with the riders’ performance, with the lap times.
  Everyone worked hard and you can see the results. I think that season
  was one of the best because we finished all races, have been on the
  podium on three of four occasions and have always been fighting for
  the top. Even in Japan, we have been close to the podium. So for sure
  we should be happy. I want to say thank you to all the BMW engineers
  for the big steps on the bike. I hope it’s only the start and we can
  be even stronger. A special thank you to my team-mates who push every
  lap. We’re learning from each other and that is great. Thanks to the
  entire team for the work – and I hope one day we will win the title.”

“Of course we are happy because to
  finish on the podium at a classic race like this is great. Also the
  result in the championship has been important after the difficult
  season we had last year, even if we had won at Spa. Now we are back,
  fighting with the top teams. That’s the positive point. But obviously
  we have been here for winning. We had some technical issues but even
  without them we could not fight for the win because I think that
  Suzuki was one step better than us. So we just have to keep working. I
  think that BMW and the team are working more than everybody else but
  endurance is like this and I think that our time will come. Let’s try
  next year!”

“It has been a super nice experience and
  great to be with the team. I was just trying to do a good fourth rider
  job as I was asked to. I anyway love being at a race with my friend
  Jérémy and trying to help him. BMW then also needed help on the
  Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team side in the Superstock class to try to
  catch the title for them because of injuries. So that was a last
  minute call. I was going cycling and everything was packed in my car
  and they called me and told me I am needed in Superstock. So I was
  really looking forward to this because it would have been really great
  to race with Kenny and Loïc. But unfortunately there was the technical
  issue early in the race. This week has been a rollercoaster of
  emotions for me. I had finished my job on Friday, then I got a new job
  but could not ride. Since then I had been supporting Jérémy and the
  #37 as much as I could. I’m really happy they’ve made it to the podium.”
