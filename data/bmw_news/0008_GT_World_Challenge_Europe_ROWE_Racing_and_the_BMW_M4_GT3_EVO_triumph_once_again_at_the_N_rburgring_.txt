Farfus started from pole position and confidently defended the lead
  during his first stint. After the first pit stops, the car dropped to
  second place, but a later second stop and a fortuitous yellow flag
  brought final driver Marciello back to the front from where he
  confidently maintained the lead until the finish. The #32 BMW M4 GT3
  EVO crew from Team WRT had a disappointing day. Ugo de Wilde, Charles
  Weerts (both BEL), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) set the fastest time
  in qualifying but received a five position grid penalty due to a
  collision. In the race, the crew lacked the necessary pace to keep up
  with the leaders and finished only in eleventh place overall, which
  meant ninth place in the Pro Cup.

There were additional podium finishes to celebrate for the BMW M
  Motorsport teams in the Gold and Silver Cups. The #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO
  from AlManar Racing by WRT, driven by Jens Klingmann (GER), Al Faisal
  Al Zubair (OMA), and Ben Tuck (GBR), finished second in the Gold Cup.
  Century Motorsport secured third place in the Silver category with the
  #42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO and drivers Mex Jansen (NED), William Moore (GBR),
  and Jarrod Waberski (RSA). Fifth and sixth places in the Silver Cup
  went to Paradine Competition and Team WRT, respectively. In the Bronze
  Cup, BMW Italia Ceccato Racing finished eighth. The #991 BMW M4 GT3
  EVO from Paradine Competition retired following an unavoidable collision.

"Congratulations to ROWE Racing on another fantastic
  triumph at the Nürburgring! I fondly remember our celebration after
  the victory at the 24-hour race in June. That was one of the absolute
  highlights of the season. Now, standing on the top step of the podium
  on the Grand Prix circuit is a very strong achievement. Thank you to
  everyone for their hard work! Congratulations also to the winning
  drivers Augusto Farfus, Jesse Krohn, and Raffaele Marciello, as well
  as to AlManar Racing by WRT and Century Motorsport for their
  additional podium finishes with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. It’s unfortunate
  that things didn’t go well for the Team WRT #32 crew. This is a
  setback in the title race, but we still have one event left in both
  the Endurance and Sprint Cups and still have every chance. We will
  analyse the Nürburgring results together and come back stronger for
  the Valencia and Barcelona races."

"Two consecutive wins at the Nürburgring after our
  triumph at the 24-hour race – that’s impressive! The drivers and team
  delivered an outstanding performance and had an almost perfect
  weekend. Qualifying went well, and we were consistently strong in the
  race. Although we temporarily lost the lead, our strategy to make the
  final stop later and potentially benefit from a yellow flag paid off.
  We’ve come back strong after the summer break and are looking forward
  to the season finale at Barcelona."

"The Nürburgring has been very kind to us this
  season! A win on the short track and one on the long circuit – that
  puts a smile on our faces. Huge compliments to ROWE Racing! We were
  competitive from the first practice session and rewarded ourselves
  with first place. Now it’s time to celebrate."

"This is a big win for the team at its home race and
  also for me. Expectations were high after our 24-hour race victory,
  but we all did a great job together and achieved the perfect result.
  I’ll remember this win for a long time. Thank you to the entire team
  and BMW M Motorsport."

"It was a very good day. We were very strong
  and showed good pace in the race, even though we temporarily lost the
  lead due to strategy. We managed to regain it. In recent years, BMW M
  Motorsport hasn’t been as strong on the Grand Prix circuit of the
  Nürburgring in the GT World Challenge Europe. It’s great to have
  changed that now."

"We lost quite a bit of time during practice and were
  therefore a bit on the back foot at the start. However, we made a
  great comeback with the fastest time in qualifying. Unfortunately, we
  received a grid penalty for the incident with the Mercedes. In my
  opinion, he crossed my line, but it is what it is. Even from sixth
  place, we still had every chance in the race, but for some reason, we
  just didn’t have the pace. Now we need to investigate why that
  happened and do better next time. Congratulations to ROWE Racing and
  the #98 crew on their victory."

"We can be proud of second
  place in the Gold Cup. I don’t think more was possible today. The
  track was very slippery, which made it quite difficult for all of us.
  But we secured another podium and lots of points for the championship.
  We’re happy with that."

"I’m super happy with our performance and
  third place. The race was chaotic at times with lots of battles, but
  we fought our way forward. Now we have every chance to win the Silver
  Cup title at the Barcelona finale. Let’s go get it!"
