  a new era. Alexander Karajlovic has been appointed the
  high-performance brand’s new Head of Development. He takes over from
  Dirk Häcker, who enters retirement after 11 years at BMW M and 37
  years with the BMW Group.

  Häcker’s departure sees the long-term Head of Development at BMW M
  GmbH bow out to start his well-earned retirement. His name is
  inextricably linked with an unprecedented product offensive, superior
  product quality and yearly sales records at BMW M. We are delighted to

  having worked at BMW M before, comes with a proven track record of
  chassis development know-how enabling him to take the helm and

  models covering all vehicle classes. They all share a combination of
  motor racing prowess and great everyday usability that makes them

  consumption with discharged battery: 10.9–10.7 l/100 km

  disciplines as well. Overall, the BMW M5 Touring scored a higher
  points total than any other vehicle in this year’s event.
