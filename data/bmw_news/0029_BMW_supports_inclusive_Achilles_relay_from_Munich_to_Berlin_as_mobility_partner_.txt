+++ A project unique so far by Achilles International Germany e.V.
  +++ On the occasion of the 50

BMW BERLIN-MARATHON,
  athletes with and without disabilities run and roll from Munich's
  Isartor to the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin +++ Eleven stages covering a
  total of 750 kilometres +++ BMW supports the inclusive relay with
  three fully electric escort vehicles +++

At 12:30 PM on Tuesday, the starting signal
  was given in front of the Isartor in Munich for an equally unusual and
  impressive running event leading to Berlin. The inclusive relay is
  organised by the Munich running club Achilles International Germany
  e.V. with the help of the Guide-Netzwerk Deutschland e.V. and the
  Sportclub Charlottenburg e.V. as the organiser of the 50

BMW BERLIN-MARATHON. BMW supports the initiative as a mobility partner
  with three fully electric escort vehicles (two BMW iX3s and one BMW iX1).

Under the motto "Von Tor zu Tor” – referring to the relay going
  from Isartor to Brandenburg Gate (in German: Brandenburger Tor) - more
  than 100 athletes with and without disabilities take to the route from
  Munich's Isartor to the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Together. Step by
  step. Stage by stage. A total of eleven segments are on the schedule,
  with the goal being reached on September 27

. Participants
  can choose the distance they want to complete. Anyone who wants to set
  a sign for inclusion can join in running or rolling: ambitious
  athletes, enthusiastic recreational athletes, and people who simply
  enjoy running in the community.

"Engaging in sports together, sharing joy, and experiencing
  diversity and something special together – that also drives BMW in its
  sports engagements," said Christian Ach, Head of BMW Germany.
  "This applies to large events like the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON with
  70,000 participants from all over the world. But even outside the
  spotlight, people are passionately committed to participation and
  connecting experiences through sports. We are all the more pleased
  that we can support the great commitment of Achilles for inclusion and
  the implementation of this inspiring running event."

Still, far too few people with disabilities have the opportunity to
  regularly engage in sports together with others. Achilles
  International Germany e.V. sets a good example where twice a week
  there is an inclusive running meeting in Munich's Olympic Park. In
  Stuttgart, Hamburg, Würzburg, and Saarbrücken, weekly running meetings
  are also organised. Together, the members also participate in local
  charity runs, as well as in major competitions such as the BMW
  BERLIN-MARATHON or the New York Marathon. The club is financed
  exclusively through donations.

"We are very pleased that with this very special relay, we can
  make a truly attractive offer so that people with disabilities can
  engage in sports together with others. ‘Von Tor zu Tor’ spans more
  than 750 kilometres. This great distance symbolically represents the
  long road that inclusion had to and still has to travel to finally
  arrive in society," said Tobias Fraas, 1

Chairman of
  Achilles International Germany e.V. "Many thanks to BMW for the
  support with the escort vehicles, which take on an important task
  during the stages in transporting materials and as a shuttle to the
  start or from the finish, without which we could not carry out the relay."

In the last five kilometres in Berlin, further Achilles members from
  all over the world will join the relay – Achilles International is
  represented in 17 countries. After arriving at the Brandenburg Gate,
  the relay finishers can expect a special reception and a surprise.
  Subsequently, the competitions at the 50

BMW
  BERLIN-MARATHON will take place in the capital over the weekend. Some
  "Von Tor zu Tor" participants will also be at the start there.

For BMW, the commitment continues. At the 50

BMW
  BERLIN-MARATHON, the company supports the organisers as the title
  partner with emission-free vehicles – from the fully electric BMW iX2
  as the Official Safety Car to the new BMW i5 as the lead vehicle for
  the men's and women's international races, to further fully electric
  BMW vehicles such as the BMW i5 Touring, the BMW i4, the BMW iX3, or
  the BMW iX1. In total, 65 BMW vehicles as well as ten motorcycles and
  four scooters will be in action.
