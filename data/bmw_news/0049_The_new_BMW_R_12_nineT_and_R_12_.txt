Josef Miritsch, Head of Air-Cooled Boxer
  Series BMW Motorrad.

With the R nineT, BMW Motorrad presented more than just a
  classic-style roadster in 2013.  From the very beginning it combined
  classic motorcycle design and modern technology with high
  craftsmanship and diverse customization options. Shortly afterwards,
  the R nineT was enriched with attractive derivatives, giving rise to a
  whole model family for the BMW Motorrad Heritage world.

That is why, for the new

, the
  guiding principle during development was

, with the goal of seamlessly following in the
  footsteps of the successful R nineT and carrying forward its
  archetypal look, timelessness, and high customization qualities. While
  the new R 12 nineT as a classic roadster aims to make a stylish
  impression in urban environments as well as provide dynamic riding fun
  on winding country roads, the new

comes
  under the motto

- perfectly
  embodying a classic cruiser for cool and relaxed biking.

The new BMW R 12 nineT and
  R 12 are classic roadsters and cruisers that combine the authentic and
  beefy character of the boxer engine and the design language of
  traditional motorcycle eras with innovative technology and a modular
  concept that offers the rider maximum customization options. Reduction
  to the essentials and attention to detail were key priorities in the
  development of the design, resulting in a strong emotional appeal.

For the past 100 years,
  the two-cylinder boxer engine and the use of a propeller shaft drive
  have been synonymous with BMW motorcycles. In line with this legacy,
  the new BMW R 12 nineT and R 12 models, presented in the “100 Years of
  BMW Motorrad” anniversary year, further emphasise this distinctive
  powertrain configuration, following the recent unveiling of the new
  BMW R 1300 GS. The air/oil-cooled boxer engine with a capacity of
  1,170 cc already familiar from numerous BMW Motorrad models, delivers

80 kW (109 hp) at 7,000 rpm in the R 12 nineT and 70 kW (95 hp)
  at 6,500 rpm in the

R 12. As part of the complete redesign of
  the chassis, the new R 12 models also feature a new airbox. This is
  now fully integrated under the seat. The left-mounted “Twin Pipe”
  exhaust system with two rear silencers with reverse cone design caters
  to both the desire for a classically designed, sporty roadster and a cruiser.

The centrepiece of the new BMW R 12 models
  is the completely newly developed tubular bridge steel spaceframe.
  This frame differs from the previous R nineT series, which had a front
  and rear main frame. As a result, the new frame eliminates the need
  for previous fastenings, reducing weight and giving the new R 12
  models a cleaner and more classic appearance. The rear frame, also
  made of tubular steel, is bolted to the main frame.

The new R 12 nineT comes equipped
  with two analogue round instruments for speed and rpms, a USB-C port
  on the left side, and a 12V socket on the right side for the onboard
  network. The round instruments continue to support customization by
  communicating via a LIN-Bus and separating the control and display
  units. The standard instrumentation for the new R 12 is limited to the
  speedometer, but the rev counter can be retrofitted with genuine BMW
  Motorcycle accessories.

On the the

the
  aluminium tank with brushed and clear-coated side panels, the seat,
  and the tail-hump create a rising, dynamic line. The improved
  ergonomics compared to its predecessor are mainly due to the 30 mm
  shorter and narrower fuel tank in the rear area.  The rider is closer
  to the handlebars, benefits from improved knee contact, and has a more
  front-oriented seating position on the motorcycle overall.

On the new

, the steel tank,
  reminiscent of the so-called “Toaster Tanks” of the 1970s BMW /5
  models, emphasises the typical design language of a cruiser in a
  classic teardrop shape and forms a descending line in combination with
  the standard solo seat and the curved, low-mounted rear wheel cover.
  The large 19-inch front wheel and the small 16-inch rear wheel
  complement this harmoniously. The classic cruiser design is also
  reflected in the relaxed seating position with low seat height and
  wide handlebars.

  in three attractive colour options.
