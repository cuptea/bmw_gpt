On September 3, 2025, during a ceremonial
  event at the Vatican, a specially customized BMW R 18 Transcontinental
  was presented to Pope Leo XIV. for blessing and signing on the motorcycle.

This uniquely customized R 18 Transcontinental, donated by BMW
  Motorrad and bearing the signature of the Pontiff, was successfully
  auctioned by Missio Austria through Sotheby's at Motorworld in Munich
  on October 18, 2025. The proceeds from this auction, amounting to
  130,000 euros, will go to children's aid projects in Madagascar.

Markus Flasch, CEO BMW Motorrad: "The fantastic result of the
  auction of our R 18 Transcontinental signed by Pope Leo XIV. is a
  wonderful final highlight of this charity campaign. Like everyone
  involved, I am also delighted that we can make a significant
  contribution with the auction proceeds of 130,000 euros to support aid
  projects for children in Madagascar together with Missio Austria. And
  of course, I wish the new owner lots of fun with this unique BMW R 18 Transcontinental.
