+++ American golfer Lucy Li secures one of three Hole-in-One Vehicles
  during the first round of the BMW Ladies Championship +++ Li achieves
  the most valuable hole-in-one of her career +++ Fourth Hole-in-One
  Award in the tournament's history +++ Two more chances for the
  world-class field: BMW iX and MINI John Cooper Works Countryman ALL4
  still up for grabs +++

The 2025 BMW Ladies Championship got off to a
  perfect start at its new venue, Pine Beach Golf Links near Gwangju in
  southwest South Korea. During the first round, Lucy Li (USA) sunk a
  hole-in-one on the 13th hole (par 3). For her spectacular shot from a
  distance of 155 yards with a 7-iron, the American golfer was rewarded
  with an all-electric BMW i7 eDrive50. The 23-year-old, currently
  ranked 97th in the world, has been playing on the LPGA Tour since 2023
  but has yet to secure a tournament victory. With today’s hole-in-one,
  Li joins the illustrious group of players who have earned themselves
  sheer driving pleasure at BMW professional tournaments around the globe.

The hole-in-one helped Li achieve an opening round of 68 strokes (4
  under par), placing her in a tie for 22nd. Leading the 78-player field
  at their home event are two South Korean golfers: Sei Young Kim (62,
  -10) is in first place, followed by Hyo Joo Kim (63, -9). Since there
  is no cut at the BMW Ladies Championship, all players still have three
  rounds to follow in Li’s footsteps and claim one of the two remaining
  Hole-in-One Awards at the only LPGA Tour stop in South Korea.
  Tournament organiser BMW Korea will reward the first hole-in-one on
  the 8th hole with a MINI John Cooper Works Countryman ALL4, while the
  all-electric premium SAV BMW iX awaits a new owner on the 15th hole.

Li is the fourth player to earn a Hole-in-One Award in the history of
  the BMW Ladies Championship. The first to do so was Kristen Gillman
  during the inaugural event in 2019. At LPGA International Busan, the
  13 (par 3) also proved to be her lucky number. From a distance of 179
  yards, Gillman holed out with a 4-hybrid, marking the first ace of her
  professional career and winning a BMW 740Li XDrive.

Three years later, something unparalleled happened at the Oak Valley
  Country Club. The BMW Group has been involved in international
  professional golf since 1989, but what occurred at the 2022 BMW Ladies
  Championship had never been seen before when two Hole-in-One Awards
  were won on the same day. During round three of the BMW Ladies
  Championship, South Korean Na Yeon Choi was rewarded for her dream
  shot on the 12th hole with a BMW X7 xDrive40i. A short while later,
  cheers rang round the course again, as Thailand’s Ariya Jutanugarn
  aced the 17th to win a BMW 740i.

Since that ‘Super-Saturday’ in October 2022, no other BMW
  professional tournament around the world has seen such a spectacular
  double. The BMW Ladies Championship 2025 offers the chance to make
  golf history once again this week.
