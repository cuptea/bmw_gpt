BMW M Motorsport teams celebrated victories and titles with the BMW
  M4 GT4 in Germany, Europe, Asia, and North America. The pleasingly
  long list of major successes includes: the SP10 class victory for FK
  Performance Motorsport at the 24h Nürburgring (GER), the SP10 overall
  victory in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS), the title win in
  the GT4 European Series for Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport, the title
  wins for Turner Motorsport in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge and
  the IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge, the title win for Auto Technic
  Racing in the GT4 America, and the title win in the GT4 Asia for YZ
  Racing with BMW Team Studie.

“What a debut year for the new BMW M4 GT4! We were confident enough
  before the season to assume that we could continue the successes of
  its predecessor with this car, but the large number of victories and
  title wins that our teams and drivers were able to achieve right away
  was even a positive surprise for us,” said Björn Lellmann, Head of
  Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport. “However, we are not settling on
  these successes. Due to the high demand, we are currently producing 50
  additional units of the BMW M4 GT4, which will be delivered to our
  customers in 2024. In addition, we have decided to develop an EVO
  version of the BMW M4 GT4 after the BMW M4 GT3. The goal is to make an
  already very strong car even better with the help of our customers' feedback.”

Planning for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO is already in full swing at BMW M
  Motorsport. Details on the improvements over the current model will be
  announced at a later date.
