After intensive months of preparation for the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the
  IMSA Series, BMW M Team WRT had three equally busy days of testing in
  Florida. For the aerodynamically revised version of the car, every
  kilometer counts in the run-up to the first major 24-hour endurance
  challenge. The data obtained will be analysed over the next few days
  in order to be optimally prepared for the upcoming race weekend.

In the GTD PRO category, Paul Miller Racing completed around 180 test
  laps with the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, while Turner Motorsport completed
  almost the same distance in the GTD class with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.

Practice for the 24 Hours of Daytona begins on Thursday at 10:05
  local time (16:05 CET), with the race starting on Saturday at 13:40
  local time (19:40 CET). The BMW M Endurance Challenge is already on
  the programme on Friday (13:45 local time, 19:45 CET). Nine BMW M4 GT4
  EVOs will be on the grid for the 4-hour race at the season opener of
  the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge.

"We’ve spent the past few days working through the
  initial adjustments as new team members joined, setting a strong
  foundation moving forward. In the practice sessions before the race,
  the focus will now be on performance, so that we have a fast car in
  the race, which we can hopefully fight for victory with. I'm really
  looking forward to getting started. We have a very strong line-up in
  the number 24."

"Of course, with so many new people in the team and in a new
  racing series for WRT, it takes some time for everything to run
  perfectly. But my impression after the Roar is positive. Everything
  worked well and we were able to complete all the test sessions without
  any technical problems. At the moment, we are still lacking a bit of
  performance, so we need to make good use of the practice sessions next
  week to improve the balance of the car."

"The Roar was particularly important in order to
  coordinate all the processes within the new team. My impression of the
  atmosphere within the crew is very positive. Of course, we also worked
  very hard to get the car into a good set-up window for the race, which
  we can hopefully utilise to achieve a strong result. We are all very
  excited about the coming week."

"We are not yet where we need to be with the
  balance of the car if we want to fight for victory next weekend. But I
  am confident that after studying the data from the Roar, we can make
  significant steps forward in the remaining practice sessions. The mood
  in the team is good. Everyone is highly motivated to send a
  competitive package into the race."

"Everything went according to plan for us at the
  Roar. The car didn't cause any problems and the team is also working
  very well. I'm really looking forward to driving with my BMW Junior
  colleagues Max and Dan again, and to be able to contest the whole
  season with Connor is great. Now we have a short break, then we can
  start again on Thursday!"

"That was a very positive test for us. As always,
  we just concentrated on ourselves and our preparation for the race.
  Lap times didn't matter at all. The car is reliable and we were able
  to complete our programme as planned. We won't know exactly where we
  stand until things get serious next week. I am confident that we are
  well prepared for the season opener."
