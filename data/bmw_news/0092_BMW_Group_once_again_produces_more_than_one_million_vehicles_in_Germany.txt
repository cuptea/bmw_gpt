  competitiveness +++

Last year, the BMW Group once again produced
  more than one million vehicles at its German plants. This means that
  one in four vehicles built in Germany comes from a BMW Group plant.
  According to the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA),
  a total of 4.15 million vehicles were manufactured in Germany during
  the same period.

“Our plants provide impressive proof of how competitive German
  industry is. Producing more than one million vehicles in 2025 is a
  strong testament to Germany’s innovative strength. To achieve this, we
  are systematically leveraging innovation and digitalisation. Going
  forward, policymakers must ensure competitive framework conditions for
  Germany as an industrial location,” explains Milan Nedeljković, member
  of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production.

The German automotive industry possesses unique expertise, extensive
  knowledge and a passionate car culture that few locations worldwide
  can match. The BMW Group vehicle plants in Dingolfing, Leipzig, Munich
  and Regensburg represent strong pillars of the company’s international
  production network. The foundation for this is a clear strategic
  direction aligned with the BMW iFACTORY, with streamlined structures,
  efficient processes and maximum flexibility at all plants. The
  BMW iFACTORY offers a vision for manufacturing across all locations in
  the global production network.

At all German plants, vehicles with internal combustion engines,
  plug-in hybrids and fully-electric drive trains are produced on a
  single line. With this flexible structure, BMW Group production can
  respond in an agile manner to fluctuations in demand and changing
  market conditions. It is therefore an important pillar supporting the
  company’s cross-functional resilience and a key competitive advantage
  in a dynamically evolving industry.

Vehicles from the German plants are primarily destined for the
  European market, in line with the principle of globally distributed
  value added. In the Americas and China, production volumes also
  roughly correspond to the number of vehicles sold in those regions.
