It was the second time Todd lifted the coveted Macau winner’s trophy.
  He also stood on the top step of the podium last year. However, that
  time the actual race could not be held due to rain, and the trophies
  were awarded to the three fastest riders in qualifying: BMW racers
  Todd, Kostamo, and Hickman. This year, the weather again caused delays
  in the motorcycle schedule and qualifying had to be moved from Friday
  to Saturday, but the 12-lap race started as planned. Todd dominated
  from pole position and crossed the finish line with a ten-second lead.

Hickman, who has already won the Macau Grand Prix four times with
  BMW, made a strong comeback from injury by taking second place.
  Kostamo, the 2022 winner and last year’s runner-up, was also among the
  favourites. Starting from second on the grid, he held the position in
  the opening laps, but a small mistake allowed Hickman to pass. In the
  end, Kostamo secured an unchallenged third place.

A total of six BMW M 1000 RR machines finished within the top ten.
  Italian Macau newcomer Maurizio Bottalico (Croweperformance /
  Bottalico) also drew attention by finishing sixth in his debut on the
  Guia Circuit. Davo Johnson (AUS / Racing for Inclusion by RVS) came
  home seventh, and Phillip Crowe (GBR / Croweperformance / Bottalico)
  finished in tenth place.

“Congratulations to Davey Todd, Peter Hickman, Erno Kostamo and
  everyone involved on this outstanding end to the season. It has not
  been an easy year for the 8Ten Racing team – in particular Peter’s
  severe injury presented the team with major challenges. All the more
  impressive, then, to see Davey’s and Peter’s squad competing under the
  Zeeco BMW Motorrad banner, as well as Erno with Racing for Inclusion
  by RVS, standing together on the podium here in Macau. We are
  incredibly proud of the riders and teams, wish them a well-deserved
  celebration in Macau, and look forward to a shared 2026 season. The
  many top-10 finishes by the BMW riders in Macau underline the
  exceptional performance of our M 1000 RR, which once again
  demonstrated its strengths on the demanding Guia Circuit.”

“I was joking with
  Pete saying that I now have one and a half Macau wins. It’s awesome to
  do that and to prove everybody wrong after saying that last year’s win
  wasn’t a proper one. I had a point to prove coming here tis year. I
  was really excited, we had a great pace, the whole Zeeco BMW Motorrad
  team has done an amazing job. I’ve been feeling awesome on the BWM M
  1000 RR all week. I am just a little bit disappointed about one thing.
  I thought that the pace was quite slow in the race, I didn’t push too
  hard when I had a gap, and then I found out that we did 23s, and I am
  sure that a new lap record with 22s would have been possible so I’m
  looking forward to being back here next year to see what else we can
  do. There are so many sponsors and partners who have helped us to even
  get out here to Macau. We really appreciate all of them and want to
  say thank you.”

“It has been a
  pretty good race. I am very content that I showed that I still have
  the pace. I was only a couple of tenths off Davey. I am sure he had
  more in the bag still but to be able to be close in the position I am
  in at the moment personally makes me really, really happy. It was
  great to show that I have the pace, I just need to work on myself now
  over winter to get ready for the 2026 season. A massive thank you to
  Zeeco BMW Motorrad, all the boys and girls and everyone that helped us
  and made sure that we got here. It has been absolutely fantastic. A
  1-2 for our team – it couldn’t get better!”

“I was
  struggling in Free Practice and had many problems with the bike but
  then in qualifying all went well. In the race I was a little bit
  nervous. I was pushing hard behind Peter and Davey. This year’s Macau
  Grand Prix was not so easy for me but I am happy.”
