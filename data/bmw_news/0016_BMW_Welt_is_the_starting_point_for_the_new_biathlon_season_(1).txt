  Olympic Park +++ Race starts and athlete presentation at BMW Welt +++

The 2025/26 biathlon season, culminating in
  the Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, will kick off this
  weekend (October 18 and 19) with a premiere event in the heart of
  Munich. At the LOOP ONE Festival in the Olympic Park, the biathlon
  elite will compete on roller skis. This innovative format, which
  includes women’s, men’s, youth, and para races around the Olympic
  Lake, will be accompanied by music acts and a diverse programme of
  activities for the whole family. Partner BMW is supporting the
  festival, which takes place near its headquarters, and has prepared
  attractive events for visitors in the Olympic Park and at BMW Welt.
  The highlight will be on Sunday with the athlete presentations (3pm
  for men, 4pm for women), followed by the race starts at BMW Welt (free
  entry). On the first section of the racecourse, the new BMW iX3 will
  lead the world-class field.

“BMW didn’t hesitate for a second to take an active role in the LOOP
  ONE Festival. We’ve been a long-standing partner of biathlon,
  sportiness is in the DNA of our brand, the event takes place right on
  our doorstep, and it’s an innovative and attractive format,“ said
  Christian Ach, Head of BMW Germany. “It’s about time that such a
  popular sport as biathlon comes to the heart of our hometown. We’re
  looking forward to an exciting weekend and special moments at BMW
  Welt, to which we warmly invite all fans.”

On Saturday at 2pm, the German Biathlon National Team will present
  itself on the main stage between the Olympic Stadium and Olympic Hall.
  BMW, as the mobility partner of the German Ski Association (DSV)
  Biathlon, will hand over the vehicle fleet for the Olympic season.
  Athletes Selina Grotian, Janina Hettich-Walz, Franziska Preuß, Vanessa
  Voigt, Johannes Kühn, Philipp Nawrath, Danilo Riethmüller, and Justus
  Strelow will not only start the winter season on the high note of the
  LOOP ONE Festival but also with the latest generation of sheer driving
  pleasure. Following the vehicle handover, the biathlon stars will be
  available for autographs.

Just a few metres from the main stage at the West Entrance, visitors
  will be greeted by a unique photo opportunity: the new BMW iX3, the
  first vehicle of the Neue Klasse, is spectacularly showcased inside a
  giant, fully functional snow globe. Visitors should also check out the
  BMW and MINI theme worlds on the peninsula near the Olympic Tower,
  featuring attractive vehicles and activities such as the BMW Touch
  & Charge Wall and the BMW Pit Stop Challenge. Young biathlon fans
  can enjoy child-friendly driving fun on the BMW Kids Course.

The sporting programme begins on Saturday at 11:30 am with the Para
  Biathlon, featuring Paralympic champions Anja Wicker (GER) and Mark
  Arendz (CAN). This will be followed by the Youth Biathlon at 4 pm. The
  LOOP ONE Festival can be visited free of charge at BMW Welt,
  throughout the festival grounds, and along the racecourse, with
  tickets only required for the shooting range and grandstand areas.
  Those unable to attend in Munich won’t miss out as Sunday’s races,
  including the athlete presentations and starts at BMW Welt, will be
  broadcast live on ARD. In addition to the German stars, reigning
  overall World Cup champion Sturla Holm Laegreid (NOR) and world
  champions Lou Jeanmonnot (FRA) and Lisa Vittozzi (ITA) will also be in action.
