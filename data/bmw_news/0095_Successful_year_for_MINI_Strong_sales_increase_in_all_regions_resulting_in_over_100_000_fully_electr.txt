The MINI brand looks back on an extremely
  successful 2025. With a total volume of 288,290 vehicles, MINI
  achieved a significant sales increase of 17,7% compared to 2024
  figures. Particularly impressive is the high demand for battery
  electric vehicles (BEVs): with 105,535 fully electric MINIs delivered
  in 2025 (+87,9%), the brand achieved a new record in electromobility,
  resulting in more than every third MINI sold worldwide being electric.
  In many markets, the share is significantly above 50%, such as
  Netherlands, Turkey, Sweden and China.

Jean-Philippe Parain, Head of the MINI brand, emphasizes: “MINI
  continuously increases the share of fully electric vehicles, thereby
  demonstrating its innovative strength and future orientation. Our
  strong volume growth across all regions in 2025 clearly reflects the
  exceptional appeal of the MINI model family. The updated iconic
  design, the sportiness, individuality and expanded electric offerings
  of the MINI brand have met customer expectations all around the globe.

A growth driver was the largest MINI model in the product portfolio,
  the MINI Countryman: with a 32,4 % share of the total MINI volume, it
  underlines the brand’s SUV expertise. The Countryman combines typical
  MINI driving pleasure with innovative design and high versatility –
  ideal for any outdoor challenge. In 2025, 93,305 units were sold
  worldwide (+15.2%); the fully electric Countryman achieved a sales
  growth of 81.8% compared to 2024.

The sporty John Cooper Works (JCW) sub-brand also set new standards
  in 2025: with 25,630 units sold, MINI JCW increased the sales volume
  by 59.5% and achieved a new sales record. The share of JCW vehicles
  reached 8.9% of the total MINI volume. In some markets, such as UK,
  Italy, Japan and Australia, the performance-enhanced MINI models
  reached their highest sales figures to date.

The traditional MINI Cooper family, consisting of the MINI Cooper
  3-Door, the MINI Cooper 5-Door and the MINI Convertible, recorded with
  162,789 a sales increase of 10.3% compared to the previous year. The
  new generation of the MINI Cooper Convertible, only introduced in
  2025, rounded off the model family with unique features. With 22,491
  units sold, a sales growth of 18.4% was achieved. The MINI Cooper
  5-Door impresses with typical brand-specific driving fun, increased
  space, and high functionality and recorded with 47,850 units a
  significant growth of 26.5% compared to 2024.

Starting in 2026, the MINI Cooper 3-Door, MINI Cooper 5-Door, and
  MINI Cooper Convertible – both electric and combustion engine versions
  – will be available in the new MINI Paul Smith Edition. This edition
  combines the unmistakable style of the British designer Paul Smith
  with the playful, optimistic and independent spirit of the MINI brand.
  Following the successful collaborations “MINI STRIP” (2021) and “MINI
  Recharged by Paul Smith” (2022), Paul Smith now brings his
  world-famous design language “Classic with a twist” into the MINI
  family once again.
