The BMW Group has reached the latest stage of
  development with the BMW iDrive system. A new home screen with clearly
  arranged functions offers greater ease of use on the BMW Curved
  Display. The system’s QuickSelect concept additionally brings an
  improved menu structure that takes its cues from consumer electronics
  devices. The new BMW iDrive plays a unique role in delivering a
  focused, assured driving experience by showing the right information
  in the right place. The new BMW iDrive system will be gradually
  introduced in current models

over the course of 2023.

“Today, BMW iDrive is more than just a control and operating
  system – it’s a digital world of experience allowing human and car to
  interact with one another and exchange information,” remarks Stephan
  Durach, Senior Vice President BMW Group Connected Company Development.
  “As we said at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January
  2023, we are continuously enhancing the associated user experience
  based on the latest available technology.” This translates into a
  broader offering of digital content for information and entertainment,
  shorter function update cycles, better information on charging points
  for electric vehicles and improved access to a host of specific online services.

With its new graphical interface and optimized menu structure,
  BMW iDrive will in future focus even more squarely on interaction by
  using the touchscreen and natural language. The BMW Curved Display
  will continue to serve as the point of interaction for the
  multi-sensory BMW iDrive experience.

The next-generation BMW iDrive turns
  the home screen on the BMW Curved Display into a permanently viewable
  user interface. Other individually configurable graphics can also be
  displayed here at all times as an alternative to the navigation
  system’s map view.

The new zero-layer principle means that all relevant functions
  and information are shown on a single level, making it possible to
  select a desired function without having to enter a submenu first.
  Instead, live widgets appear in a vertical arrangement on the driver’s
  side of the user interface. These function icons can be selected with
  a swipe of the finger and also configured individually. The
  QuickSelect functionality makes it possible to directly select
  entertainment programmes, contact lists and vehicle settings, start
  interaction with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant or activate
  other menu options, all by touch. And once the relevant settings have
  been chosen, a quick tap on the home icon at the lower edge of the
  display is all it takes to return to the home screen.

The operating concept for the new BMW iDrive therefore
  aligns with user habits established with today’s consumer electronics
  devices. The new, flat menu structure makes activating functions and
  settings much faster and simpler. At the same time, the system goes a
  long way towards enriching the driving experience in a BMW. The
  digital content is – just like the hardware, in the form of the BMW
  Curved Display – designed to enhance the driver focus for which BMW is
  renowned. BMW iDrive provides the right information in the right place
  and at the right time.

To ensure intuitive interaction whilst driving, the graphical
  interface and menu structure feature a layout developed by BMW Group
  Design that is both consistent and characteristic of the brand. As a
  result, customers can enjoy a signature BMW user experience at all times.

The new BMW iDrive with QuickSelect is a
  further development of the BMW Operating System 8 fitted in current
  BMW models with BMW Curved Display, and is based on the
  latest-generation infotainment head units, which is also responsible
  for graphic processing.

The new BMW Operating System 8.5 will be gradually introduced in
  all midsize, executive and luxury model ranges

from BMW.
  It will continue to be based on Linux and will be combined with the
  largest version of the BMW Curved Display.

The digital experience on the specific BMW Curved Display of the
  compact-class models

with the new BMW Operating System 9,
  based on Android Open Source Project software, is being developed.

When the BMW iDrive system was
  first launched in 2001 with the new BMW 7 Series, its main purpose was
  to use one display and one interactive element for as many functions
  as possible in order to cut down on the number of buttons, controls
  and displays. The BMW iDrive Controller therefore acquired the status
  of universal control device as we knew it from a computer mouse.
  Scrolling and clicking on a desktop became turning, pushing and
  pressing in a car – intuitively and with minimal distraction from the
  road ahead.

After about 20 years, the digital user experience is dominated
  by touchpads, touch-sensitive smartphone displays and voice
  assistants. Swiping, tapping and speaking are the most common methods
  of interaction. The BMW Curved Display’s touchscreen functionality and
  dialogue using natural language represent the contemporary form of
  interaction between human and car.
