The new BMW iX3 and its trailblazing
  innovations will be shown at the CES 2026. Having won multiple
  innovation- and car-of-the-year awards* even before hitting the
  streets, the first vehicle of BMW’s Neue Klasse is set to impress the
  visitors of the most influential technology trade show.

At the BMW booth in the Silver Lot in front of the South Hall at the
  Las Vegas Convention Center, visitors can experience the BMW Panoramic
  iDrive with the new AI-powered BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant in
  the BMW iX3. Through its collaboration with Amazon, BMW becomes the
  first automaker to integrate Alexa+ technology into its vehicles—a
  major step forward for in-vehicle conversational AI. With natural
  dialogue and intelligent capabilities, the system moves beyond simple
  voice commands to deliver a context-aware, personalized experience
  that helps drivers stay focused on the road. This new level of voice
  interaction can also be experienced at Amazon’s Devices & Services
  Exhibit in the Venetian Hotel, Ballrooms G-J.

The new BMW iX3 represents a leap forward in development that extends
  well beyond the reaches of a conventional model renewal. The advances
  made in terms of design and technology create the impression that a
  complete vehicle generation has been skipped. For the BMW Group, the
  launch of the new BMW iX3 also represents a milestone in the
  transformation process when it comes to electrification,
  digitalization and circularity. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue
  Klasse, it offers customers the latest design and technological
  innovations, which will shape the brand’s entire model range moving
  forwards. The technologies of the Neue Klasse will be incorporated
  into a total of 40 new models and model updates between now and 2027.

In 2023, the BMW i Vision Dee showed a vision of the Neue Klasse
  becoming a true companion with conversational AI capabilities. With a
  gigantic dashboard, the new display and operating concept BMW
  Panoramic iDrive was revealed in a spectacular way at CES 2025. With
  the new BMW iX3 coming to CES 2026, which embodies these key
  innovations, the BMW Group delivers on the promises made at previous
  CES appearances.
