Sheer driving pleasure has always been baked into the BMW brand’s
  DNA. The BMW Z4 is a prime example: truly exhilarating roadster fun.
  Since the start of the first model generation in 2002, this open-top
  sports car has been wowing customers with its unique combination of
  peerless design, a purist driving experience and sporty dynamics. The
  upcoming BMW Z4 Final Edition provides fans with a time-limited
  opportunity to order a very special version of this vehicle – one that
  may well become a collectors’ item. It comes with specific equipment
  elements that create individual highlights on the outside as well as
  in the interior. At the same time, the Final Edition represents this
  iconic two‑seater’s crowning glory. Production of the BMW Z4 will come
  to an end in March 2026.

Customers will have a short order window for the BMW Z4 Final
  Edition, beginning in late January 2026.

The distinguishing exterior feature of the BMW Z4 Final Edition is
  its exclusive Frozen Matt Black paint finish. This colour, which
  underlines the model’s individual and dynamic flair, is only available
  for the Final Edition of the BMW Z4. It looks particularly impressive
  when combined with the M High-gloss Shadowline exterior trim, which is
  part of all Final Edition models. In addition to Frozen Matt Black,
  customers can select other colours from the BMW Z4 range, at no extra
  cost. The M Sport brake in High-gloss Red is also included with the
  BMW Z4 Final Edition. It impresses with particularly effective
  deceleration and attractive looks.

The distinctive contrasting red seams selected especially for the
  Final Edition provide a literal common thread which, in this case,
  ties together the instrument panel, centre console, door trims and M
  Sport seats in Vernasca

Leather/Alcantara. Another attractive eye-catcher is the M Alcantara
  steering wheel with contrasting seams to match. It accentuates the
  sporty character of the BMW Z4 Final Edition to perfection, while
  specially engraved door sill strips enhance its exclusivity.

The Final Edition is available for the 145 kW/197 hp BMW Z4 sDrive20i
  (WLTP combined (EnVKV): fuel consumption 7.4–7.3 litres/100 km;
  CO

emissions: 166–164 g/km, CO

class F)* as
  well as the BMW Z4 sDrive30i delivering 190 kW/258 hp of power (WLTP
  combined (EnVKV): fuel consumption 7.4 litres/100 km; CO

emissions: 167 g/km, CO

class F)*. The Edition also
  extends to the range-topping BMW Z4 M40i (WLTP combined (EnVKV): fuel
  consumption 8.7–8.0 litres/100 km; CO

emissions: 197–181
  g/km, CO

class G)* powered by a 250 kW/340 hp six-cylinder
  in-line engine.

Offered for all models regardless of the transmission selected, the
  Final Edition trim level costs 4,200 euros. It requires the M Sport
  package already included as standard in the BMW Z4 sDrive30i and BMW
  Z4 M40i. With the BMW Z4 sDrive20i, the Final Edition is charged at
  7,400 euros, as the M Sport package is not part of the standard
  equipment for this engine variant and is therefore added to the
  vehicle at the usual cost of 3,200 euros.

The BMW Z4 is part of a long-standing BMW tradition of open-top
  two‑seater sports cars. This successful lineage includes icons such as
  the BMW 328 Roadster, the BMW 507 and the BMW Z8.

The BMW Z4 had its premiere in autumn 2002, as the direct successor
  to the BMW Z3 launched in 1995. And, like its predecessor, the BMW
  roadster known internally as the E85 series was produced at the BMW
  Plant Spartanburg in the US state of South Carolina.

With its long bonnet and short rear, the design of the BMW Z4
  signalled power and sporting prowess. In the cabin, the low seating
  position just in front of the rear axle made for an unforgettable
  roadster driving experience. The BMW Z4 set new standards with a
  torsional stiffness previously unmatched in the convertible and
  roadster segment. Its supreme agility was also due to its 50/50 weight
  distribution. The BMW Z4 M Roadster was the first generation’s
  range-topper. Fitted with the 252 kW/340 hp six-cylinder in-line
  engine from the BMW M3, it accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.0 seconds.

In December 2008 BMW introduced the second generation of the Z4 to
  the world. The new two-seater known internally as the E89 model series
  again combined classic proportions with leading-edge engineering.

It came with a completely new, electro-hydraulically retractable
  hardtop made up of two roof sections. Featuring an aluminium shell
  design, the hardtop was included as standard and could be opened or
  closed at the touch of a button in just 20 seconds. With the hardtop
  in place, the BMW Z4 offered the refined comfort of a sporty premium
  coupé. The interior of the new BMW Z4 had gained much over the
  first-generation model in terms of headroom and elbow room. In
  addition, this marked the first time the roadster used the BMW iDrive
  infotainment system.

BMW premiered the third – and current – generation of the BMW Z4 in
  August 2018 at Pebble Beach Golf Links near Monterey, California. The
  BMW Z4 world premiere revealed a modern interpretation of the classic
  open-top sports car. A premium roadster boasting an electrically
  operated fabric softtop, sporty handling and a purist, driver-focused
  interior design. This was complemented by premium-quality driver
  assistance, infotainment and connectivity features. Unparalleled in
  this segment is the three-litre straight-six engine with M TwinPower
  Turbo technology in the BMW Z4 M40i, which has been offered with a
  manual transmission since 2024 as the Pure Impulse Edition. The Final
  Edition will be the pinnacle of the third-generation BMW Z4.
