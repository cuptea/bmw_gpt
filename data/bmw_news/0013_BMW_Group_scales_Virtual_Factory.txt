The BMW Group is industrialising its Virtual
  Factory, with production planners continuously scaling applications in
  the digital twins of over 30 production sites to accelerate production
  planning worldwide. What once required several weeks of real-world
  modifications and testing can now be precisely simulated in the BMW
  Group’s Virtual Factory. To create optimal conditions for upcoming
  launches at the plants, the BMW Group will integrate more than 40 new
  or updated vehicles into its global production between now and 2027.
  This will first be done virtually to ensure immediate stability at the
  plants. Going forward, the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory is projected to
  reduce production planning costs by up to 30 percent.

Virtual planning is a core element of the BMW Group iFACTORY and
  involves a wide range of tools. The intelligent linking of building
  data, equipment data, logistics data, vehicle data and even 3D
  simulation of manual work processes creates digital twins of all BMW
  Group plants worldwide. In an industrial 3D metaverse application
  based on NVIDIA Omniverse, simulations can be performed in real time,
  enabling virtual optimisation of layouts, robotics and logistics
  systems. The BMW Group’s Virtual Factory is continuously expanding to
  incorporate generative and agentic AI functionalities and assistants.

For every launch, it is essential to verify that the new product fits
  on the production line and does not collide with its surroundings at
  any point. In the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory, this collision check is
  digital, automated and fast, using construction data combined with 3D
  scans. The movement and rotation of a vehicle through the production
  lines are precisely simulated, allowing the system to automatically
  check for possible collisions. What now takes just three days to
  simulate virtually previously required almost four weeks of real testing.

In the past, a real vehicle body had to be manually guided through
  the production lines – often over several weekends – to identify
  potential collisions. In the paint shop, this process sometimes
  required completely emptying and cleaning the dip coating tanks where
  vehicle bodies are submerged for priming. The costs and time
  investment for this were enormous.

The BMW Group's Virtual Factory is rapidly evolving, enabling an
  increasing number of applications to be scaled. In addition to
  virtual, automated collision checks, this includes human simulation to
  optimise manual production steps and automated identification of maps
  of the surroundings from existing 3D scans for smart transport systems.
