. In 2026, BMW will expand its BMW
  Intelligent Personal Assistant, built on Amazon’s AI Alexa+
  architecture, taking voice interaction between humans and vehicles to
  a new level.

BMW will become the first car manufacturer to integrate the AI
  assistant technology into its vehicles, starting with the BMW iX3.
  This new functionality enables intuitive and intelligent interaction
  between passengers and the vehicle in a natural dialogue including
  both the operation of vehicle functions as well as access to
  information and knowledge beyond the vehicle.

For the first time, users will also be able to ask multiple questions
  in a single sentence covering both your vehicle’s features and general
  knowledge topics.

The ability to link the BMW Intelligent
  Personal Assistant with Amazon accounts will also make it easier to
  search for and stream music, retrieve public news, and access a wide
  range of other content.

"Our partnership with Amazon is based on a shared vision of
  technological excellence," says Stephan Durach, BMW Group –
  Senior Vice President Development, Digital Services, Infotainment,
  Connected Company. "This has resulted in a product that sets new
  standards in the naturalness of human-vehicle interaction through the
  use of artificial intelligence. With the addition of Amazon's Alexa+
  technology to the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, the vehicle
  becomes an intelligent companion for its users."

“BMW Group has been fantastic to work with as we introduce the first
  implementation of the new Alexa Custom Assistant. BMW’s advanced
  technology, combined with the intelligence and conversational
  capabilities of Alexa+, creates a truly sophisticated in-vehicle
  experience." says Daniel Rausch, Vice President of Alexa and Echo.

Natural language and free choice of words represent the
  latest development of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The use
  of predefined voice commands (intents) is no longer necessary. This
  means that with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, various
  requests and queries can be linked together as in a normal human
  conversation, and follow-up questions can be asked. BMW customers can
  trust that their vehicle understands them in context and provides the
  appropriate answers. For example

, when asked, “Hey BMW
  what’s the most famous painting there is in the world and where can I
  find it?” the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant will provide the
  corresponding answer (e.g., Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci, Louvre) and
  can link this answer directly to other vehicle functions such as
  navigation. The follow-up request "Take me there!" will then
  enable direct guidance to the exhibition location of the artwork. The
  intelligent voice assistant also uses such interactive dialogues to
  respond even more precisely to future voice commands and anticipate
  the intent of the question.

The integration of Amazon Alexa+ architecture into the BMW
  Intelligent Personal Assistant represents a technological leap forward
  that focuses on added value for the customer.

The AI technology used in the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is a
  Large Language Model (LLM), a generative AI that understands language
  and is capable of formulating its own responses.

The enhanced AI-supported BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant will be
  presented to the public for the first time at CES 2026 in Las Vegas.
  Starting in the second half of 2026, BMW iX3 customers in Germany and
  the US will be the first to benefit from the advantages of the BMW
  Intelligent Personal Assistant powered by Amazon Alexa+. Other markets
  and model series will follow gradually. The UI/UX of the BMW iX3 is
  based on the new BMW Panoramic iDrive control concept with BMW
  Operating System X.

This integration is an important step on the BMW Group's path to
  offering this AI technology across the entire BMW model
  range

. It exemplifies the seamless integration of the
  "software-defined vehicle" (SDV) into the customer's digital ecosystem.

The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has played a central role in
  the BMW iDrive operating concept since 2018. In 2022, the addition of
  Amazon Alexa Custom Assistant to the BMW Intelligent Personal
  Assistant led to even more information diversity, faster response
  times, and better understanding of user requests. Most recently, in
  2025, the intelligent voice assistant was expanded for all BMW
  vehicles with Operating System 9 to include new functions such as
  music search, news, sports, and general knowledge. The integration of
  Amazon Alexa+ technology into the next-generation BMW Intelligent
  Personal Assistant demonstrates the innovative power of the
  cooperation between the BMW Group and Amazon.

The video in the press release shows a question in
  English. For the market launch, the corresponding languages, German
  and English, will be offered for Germany and the US respectively.

Latest in the 2

half of 2026, gradually for
  all BMW models with BMW Operating System 9 and X.
