Today, the Board of Management of BMW AG has
  changed the outlook for the 2025 financial year.

Whereas the company delivered volume growth year to date September in
  the

European and Americas regions, however, the targeted volume
  growth in China remained below expectations. On this basis, the BMW
  Group decided to reduce volume expectations for the Chinese market in
  the fourth quarter. Additionally, the impact of a significant
  reduction of commissions from local Chinese banks in connection with
  the brokering of financial and insurance products to end customers
  requires financial support to strengthen dealer profitability.

Furthermore, some of the assumptions on tariff reductions made at the
  time of its half year reporting have not been fully realised to date.
  In this context the BMW Group continues, however, to maintain the
  assumption that the EU implement the agreement with the US on
  reduction of tariffs from 10% to 0% on the import of vehicles and auto
  parts into the EU effective 1st August.

Accounting for these additional factors weighing on profit, the Auto
  EBIT margin for 2025 will remain in the guided corridor of 5% to 7%,
  more specifically in the range of 5% to 6%.

The outlook for the 2025 financial year has been adjusted as follows:

Contrary to assumptions made to date, the BMW Group now assumes that
  reimbursements of customs duties from the American and German
  authorities totaling a high three-digit million figure will not be
  received in 2025, but only paid in 2026. Considering these
  reimbursements and the impact on profit outlined above, free cashflow
  in Segment Automotive for the year 2025 is expected to be above €2.5bn
  (previously above €5bn).

The dividend payout ratio remains in the corridor of 30% to 40% of
  net income attributable to BMW AG shareholders. Additionally, the BMW
  Group remains committed to the share buyback program.

The full quarterly results and the adjusted outlook report will be
  published on

5 November 2025 in the BMW Group Quarterly
  Statement to 30 September 2025. The definitions of the KPIs can be
  found in the Glossary of the BMW Group Report 2024 on pages 427 to 429.
