The BMW Group’s performance in the year to
  date has been characterised by robust global sales development,
  disciplined cost management and a consistent strategic framework.

The Automotive Segment EBIT margin remained within the full-year
  target range for both the first nine months and the third quarter –
  despite continuing geopolitical challenges and intensifying
  competition. Customer deliveries rose slightly year-to-to date at the
  end of September, while free cash flow in the Automotive Segment stood
  at € 2,688 million after nine months. On Wednesday, based on these
  results, the Munich premium manufacturer confirmed its adjusted
  financial full-year targets announced in October.

“In the third quarter, we once again proved that our business model
  is robust and resilient”, said

. “We have all the right
  factors for continued success: a technology-neutral approach, exciting
  products, a strong global presence and outstanding innovation
  capabilities throughout the entire value chain. Thanks to our broad
  model and drive train portfolio, we were able to increase our global
  sales – with BMW M and our electrified vehicles as the main growth
  drivers. At the same time, we remain fully on track to meet Europe's
  ambitious CO

targets for 2025 – without relying on
  flexibility mechanisms or pooling. This demonstrates that our
  technology-neutral approach is working and delivering strong results.”

Year-on-year, the BMW Group achieved a slight

increase in deliveries, reaching a total of

in the YTD September (2024:
  1,754,157vehicles). In the third quarter, the premium manufacturer
  delivered

BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce

to customers (2024: 540,881 vehicles/

The success of the BMW Group's technology-neutral strategy was
  particularly evident at both ends of the drive train line-up: In the
  first nine months, the strongest growth came from BMW M models (+7.9%)
  and from electrified vehicles (+15%). In the year to the end of
  September, electrified models accounted for 26.2% of total sales
  (2024: 23.3%), with BEVs representing 18.0% (2024: 16.8%).

In Europe, electrified vehicles gained even higher shares: they made
  up no less than 40.9% (301,947 units) of all sales while
  fully-electric vehicles comprised a quarter during the same period
  (189,269 units; 25,5%).

The BMW Group expects further positive growth momentum in 2026 from
  the all-new BMW iX3*, the first model of the Neue Klasse.

“The response to the BMW iX3 has been extremely positive: In Europe,
  new orders significantly exceed our expectations, confirming the
  strong customer interest,” said

. “With the
  Neue Klasse, we are making a major leap forward – in technology,
  driving experience and design. Our entire product line-up will benefit
  from these innovations within a short timeframe: Between now and 2027,
  we will bring 40 new and updated models to market – across all
  segments and drive train variants. Next year, we will already
  celebrate the next premiere, with the BMW i3, as we electrify the
  heart of BMW.”

During the nine-month period, the BMW Group benefited from its
  globally balanced footprint, which helps the company offset
  differences in sales performance across key regions worldwide.
  Excluding Chinese sales, the

  key regions of Europe (+8.6%) and the Americas (+9.5%).

). Headwinds
  resulted from intensified global competition and financial measures
  aimed at supporting and strengthening dealer profitability in the
  challenging China market. Volume growth predominantly takes place
  there in the price segment below RMB 150,000 (~€ 18,000) and the
  growing product offer of local manufacturers leads to fierce
  competition across the entire market.

Additionally, negative currency translation effects, particularly
  from the US dollar, South Korean won and Chinese renminbi, have
  dampened income.

Excluding

of around 1.1 percentage points, the EBIT
  margin was 7.0% for the year to the end of September and 6.3% for the
  third quarter. Expenses resulting from higher import tariffs in the
  United States and the European Union further weighed on these margins:
  amounting to approx. 1.5 percentage points in the first nine months
  and around 1.75 percentage points in the third quarter.

Free cash flow improved year-on-year, bolstered by higher cash
  inflows from operating activities, significantly lower investment
  activity (- € 1.4 billion) and reduced inventory levels, reaching

at the end of the nine-month
  period. In the third quarter, free cash flow totalled

(2024: - € 191 million; Q3 2024: - €
  2,480 million). For the full year, the segment's free cash flow is now
  expected to be >

(previously: > €
  5 billion).

The BMW Group is implementing its

with continuity and consistency: Following the
  renewed authorisation of the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2025,
  the Board of Management has approved a third share buyback programme,
  with a volume of up to € 2 billion, to be completed by 30 April 2027.
  Acquisition of the first tranche of € 750 million began in May 2025
  and will be completed no later than 8 December 2025.

As of 30 September 2025, BMW AG held more than 6.2 million treasury
  shares from the third buyback programme. Based on the authorisation
  granted at the Annual General Meeting of 14 May 2025, as of 30
  September 2025, BMW AG had purchased shares equivalent to 1.01% of the
  share capital.

“With the third share buyback programme since 2022, the BMW Group is
  consistently implementing its shareholder return strategy. We remain
  committed to our shareholders and stand by the announcements we have
  made. Our employee share programme will also continue,” said

. “At the same time, we are maintaining our
  payout ratio of 30-40% of net income attributable to BMW AG shareholders.”

In the

  financing and leasing

concluded in the
  first nine months of the year rose slightly to

(2024: 1,252,251
  contracts/

). This significant growth in new
  business in the third quarter (

contracts/

) was mainly due to a shift in the
  Chinese competitive landscape, where local banks have substantially
  reduced their commission rates for brokering financial and insurance
  products to retail customers.

The segment's

For the year to the end of September, the segment reported

(2024: € 2,146

). This dampening effect was mainly due
  to lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, with the
  number of returned vehicles below the previous year's level. For the

In the

within the range of 5.5-7.5%is forecast as before, with a

of 13-17%. The segment is now anticipating a
  slight decrease in customer deliveries (previously: slight increase).

The BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from the
  expectations outlined above – for example, due to changes in political
  and macroeconomic conditions. Risks to earnings could arise, among
  other factors, from changes in tariff policy or Chinese export
  restrictions affecting rare earths, battery cell production or
  semiconductors. At the same time, opportunities could result from a
  reduction in existing tariffs or a shorter period of validity. The
  company continues to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely.

The BMW Group will continue to benefit from its young and attractive
  product line-up and from its proven technology-neutral approach. At
  the same time, thanks to its flexibility, globally balanced footprint
  and strong financial position, the company is able to adapt to dynamic
  market conditions, while consistently pursuing long-term success.

Battery Electric Vehicle.

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed
  over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease
  contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end
  users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a
  service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third
  parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers
  when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group.
  Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international
  subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party
  dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of
  deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party
  dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do
  not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises
  in respect of that particular reporting period.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result
  comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative
  expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

Profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.

EBIT plus financial result.

Profit/loss as a percentage of revenues.

Return on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and
  Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment
  profit before financial result and the average amount of capital
  employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment
  concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and
  non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not
  incur interest.

Return on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is
  calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average
  amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters –
  attributable to the Financial Services segment.
