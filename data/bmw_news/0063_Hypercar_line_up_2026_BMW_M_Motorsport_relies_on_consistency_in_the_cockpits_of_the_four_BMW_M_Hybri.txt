The eight drivers for BMW M Motorsport’s works programmes in the FIA
  WEC and IMSA Series in 2026 are once again: Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin
  Frijns (NED), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), René
  Rast (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and
  Marco Wittmann (GER). As in the previous year, Vanthoor and van der
  Linde will undertake double duty as regular drivers in both race
  series. Eng and Wittmann will return for another full season in North
  America, where BMW M Team WRT will take over operations from BMW M
  Team RLL. Starting in 2026, the Belgian team will compete with the BMW
  M Hybrid V8 in both the FIA WEC and IMSA Series.

In FIA WEC, the driver line-ups for both cars remain unchanged. The
  #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 will be shared by Magnussen, Marciello, and
  Vanthoor. In the #20 car, Frijns, Rast, and van der Linde will
  alternate. In the IMSA Series, there will be a swap in driver
  pairings. Regular drivers in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 will be Vanthoor
  and van der Linde. They will be supported in endurance races by Frijns
  and Rast. In the #25 car, Eng and Wittmann will contest the full
  season together. They will be joined by Magnussen and Marciello for
  endurance races.

“Consistency
  was our priority when selecting the Hypercar drivers for the 2026
  season. We are very satisfied with the performance of all eight
  drivers, and there is no reason to make major changes. With every
  race, our drivers gain more experience with the BMW M Hybrid V8, which
  is crucial for the continued progress of our programme. In 2026, we
  will race with an updated car and a new team in the IMSA Series.
  That’s enough change, so it was important for us to maintain
  continuity on the driver side. The key is that everyone works well as
  a team, pulls together, and advances our LMDh project. That’s exactly
  what’s happening. I’m very much looking forward to continuing this collaboration.”
