In a highly volatile environment, the BMW
  Group remained on course in the first half of 2022. With flexibility
  and expertise, the company encountered challenges including continued
  supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks for semiconductors and
  specific supplier parts.

The BMW Group’s underlying strength and operational excellence was
  reflected in its profits for the first six months: Despite the
  volatility, the company earned a

  previously held shares in the Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance
  Automotive Ltd. (BBA) contributed to the high return. This revaluation

‒ well above the long-term strategic corridor of 8-10%.

“Especially under unfavourable conditions, the BMW Group is
  characterized by a high degree of resilience. The company recognizes
  changes in the economic environment at an early stage and counteracts
  them accordingly. Our high degree of flexibility and operational
  performance have proven time and again to be an effective combination
  to ensure the BMW Group's successful course even in rough waters. This
  strength will now be important again, as we see an increasing economic
  headwind coming up in addition to the ongoing supply shortages,” said
  BMW AG

in Munich on Wednesday.

To the long-term success of BMW Group contribute its pioneering
  spirit and consistent focus on innovation. An upcoming proof-point of
  its innovative strength is the pure electric NEUE KLASSE. It will be
  fully geared towards sustainability and circular economy, using new
  technologies and production processes from the middle of the decade
  onwards. The all-electric products of NEUE KLASSE will make a
  significant contribution to BMW Group sales volumes from the middle of
  the decade onwards and will further accelerate the ramp-up of e-mobility.

“Emotional products and innovative technology are and will remain the
  backbone of our business success. Our rapidly growing range of
  all-electric vehicles with the BMW Operating System 8 impresses
  customers and experts alike — and is already a central driver of our
  sales today,” said

. “From 2025, we will make
  the next big leap with the NEUE KLASSE: The NEUE KLASSE defines what
  the BMW Group stands for in the future. At the start, we are planning
  a compact sedan in the 3‑series segment and a sporty SUV. By the end
  of the decade, the NEUE KLASSE is expected to account for more than
  half of our sales.”

In the first half of 2022, the BMW Group was able to more than double
  its sales of

The financial key figures for the Automotive Segment show significant
  effects from the full consolidation of BBA during the reporting
  period. Segment revenues rose significantly to

; Q2 2021: € 24,982

As before, the BMW Group continued to benefit from

and from

. Revenues were also lifted by
  currency translation effects. In particular, the positive situation on
  the used car markets in the USA, UK and Germany led to higher revenues
  from the sale of end-of-lease vehicles.

The segment

rose to

  contributor to this increase. In addition,

to this amount. In view
  of the strong demand for all-electric vehicles, the BMW Group will
  increase its investments in electromobility from the second half of
  the year. In addition, the company expects a slight decline in
  deliveries for the full year. This will only be partially offset by
  positive price and mix effects and the development of the used car
  markets. As a consequence, it will now be targeting a

The BMW Group expects business conditions to remain difficult in the
  second half of the year. The ongoing supply bottlenecks, particularly
  for semiconductors, the war in Ukraine and interruptions in supply
  chains have led to a decline in deliveries in the Automotive segment
  in the first half of the year. Although the company expects sales
  volumes in the second half of the year to be solidly higher than in
  the same period of the previous year, this will not fully compensate
  for lost volume in HY1 2022. As a consequence, deliveries for the year
  are expected to be slightly below previous year.

The percentage of electrified vehicles should still increase
  significantly and sales of fully-electric vehicles are expected to
  more than double.

CO₂ emissions in the EU new car fleet can still be expected to be
  slightly reduced. The significant increase in the proportion of
  electrified vehicles in total deliveries of the BMW Group is decisive
  for this.

As before, the company anticipates

  partially offset by positive price and mix effects and the continued
  good development of the used car markets. RoCE in the automotive

  range of 8 to 10% and the segment ROCE in a corridor of 19 to 24%.

In the

  good performance in the used car markets led to a rising segment

(previously: 14 to 17%).

Based on current assessments, the Financial Services segment has
  recognised appropriate levels of provisions/ allowances to cover
  residual value and credit risks.

The targets outlined above are intended to be achieved with
  significantly higher employee numbers, resulting from the full
  consolidation of BBA. The proportion of women in management positions
  in the BMW Group should rise slightly regardless of the full consolidation.

Ongoing inflation and interest rate hikes will continue to shape the
  macroeconomic environment in the coming months and impact demand.

Accordingly, the above-average order bank — particularly in Europe —
  is expected to normalize towards the end of the year.

Further significant tightening of sanctions against Russia or
  reactive measures by Russia, an interruption of the gas supply
  impacting own plants and suppliers’ locations, as well as the
  possibility of the conflict spreading outside of Ukraine and further
  extended and ongoing Covid lockdowns are not factored into this guidance.

The actual business performance of the BMW Group may differ from
  current expectations given the numerous uncertainties and existing
  risks and opportunities.

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once its handed
  over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease
  contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end
  users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a
  service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third
  parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers
  when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group.
  Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international

  dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of
  deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party
  dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do
  not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises
