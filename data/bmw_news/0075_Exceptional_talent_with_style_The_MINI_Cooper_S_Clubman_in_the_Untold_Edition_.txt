The unmistakable appearance of the MINI
  Clubman is characterized by the unique body concept with four doors, a
  particularly long roofline and the side-opening split doors at the
  rear. Thanks to the specific design features of the Untold Edition,
  the spacious exceptional talent succeeds in making a particularly
  charismatic appearance. As of now, the MINI Cooper S Clubman (fuel
  consumption combined: 7.1 - 6.7 l/100 km; CO

emissions
  combined: 161 - 152 g/km according to WLTP) is also available in the
  Untold Edition in the new bodycolor Midnight Black.

The interior with seating for five and a generous, variable
  stowage volume that can be expanded from 360 to up to 1250 liters
  characterize the versatile functionality of the MINI Cooper S Clubman.
  The Untold Edition pairs the everyday practicality of the special
  model with stylish sportiness. The new Midnight Black paint finish
  characterizes the body along with the design of the front and rear
  aprons inspired by the John Cooper Works Aerodynamic Kit. Framed by
  the black band along the wheel arches, the new bodycolor enhances the
  strong character expression of the shooting-brake design. The
  four-cylinder gasoline engine with 131 kW/178 hp accelerates from 0 to
  100 km/h in 7.2 seconds.

The sportiness of the MINI Cooper S Clubman in the Untold
  Edition is underscored by the five narrow Sport Stripes arranged
  parallel to one another and running centrally across the hood and
  roof. The graphic stripe pattern is one of the specific features of
  the Untold Edition. It also adorns the side scuttles, the logo
  projection emitted from the exterior mirrors and the door sill trims
  in the paint finish Refined Brass.

The color is also found in the design of the 18-inch light-alloy
  wheels developed exclusively for the edition vehicle. The bicolor
  surfaces of the rims, which feature the Untold Spoke design, combine
  the paint finishes Jet Black/Refined Brass for a glamorous appearance.

The black sports seats in the MINI Yours Leather Lounge Carbon
  Black version transfer the confident aura of the exterior to the
  interior. Illuminated accent strips and exclusively designed interior
  surfaces with a discreet striped pattern, combined with the surrounds
  of the air vents reminiscent of refined brass, set noble accents.

In addition, the particularly high-quality equipment of the MINI
  Clubman in the Untold Edition will be enhanced by the MINI Driving
  Assistant as standard from November 2022. The driving assistance
  system includes additional functions that further enhance comfort and
  safety. For example, the included Active Guard driving function can
  help avoid collisions with a vehicle in front or stationary at speeds
  between 10 and 60 km/h by braking the vehicle.  And with camera-based
  Active Cruise Control (ACC), in addition to the set speed, the
  distance to the vehicle in front is also automatically regulated at
  speeds between 30 and 140 km/h.
