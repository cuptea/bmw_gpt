The fully electric MINI Cooper - which has
  already been awarded 5 stars in the Euro NCAP crash testing in March
  2025 - has once again received outstanding recognition from the
  esteemed Euro NCAP institute: the "Best in Class for Safest City
  & Supermini of the Year 2025." This prestigious award
  emphasises MINI's leading position in safety within the premium small
  car segment. With its three variants - MINI Cooper E, MINI Cooper SE,
  and MINI John Cooper Works Electric - the model impresses not only
  with its electric drive technology and characteristic go-kart feeling,
  but also with its comprehensive standard safety equipment.

Jean-Philippe Parain, Head of the MINI brand, emphasises: “We are
  very pleased about yet another accolade for the MINI Cooper Electric,
  which has just won the Euro NCAP Best in Class. This award is another
  compelling confirmation that MINI models offer outstanding safety. The
  MINI Cooper, as well as the MINI Countryman and MINI Aceman, have been
  rated with the maximum number of stars. This underlines our commitment
  to ensuring both driving pleasure and maximum safety standards.”

Euro NCAP praises the consistent advancement in occupant protection,
  active and passive safety systems, as well as innovative driver
  assistance technologies that make urban driving safer. The fully
  electric MINI Cooper features an integrated safety concept with
  comprehensive occupant protection, standard pelvic seatbelt
  pretensioners, and a wide range of assistance systems to prevent accidents.

Protection of pedestrians and cyclists also achieves a very high
  score for this vehicle class, tallying 77 percent in the 2025 Euro
  NCAP crash test. Safety ratings are also outstanding with 89 percent
  in occupant protection, 87 percent in child safety, and 79 percent in
  safety assist systems.

The combination of top-level safety, driving enjoyment, and iconic
  design makes the second generation of the fully electric MINI Cooper
  the ideal vehicle for today’s demands of urban mobility.
