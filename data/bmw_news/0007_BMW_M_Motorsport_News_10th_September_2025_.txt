“At the very top of my success list this week is not a race result –
  as impressive as they were. I am absolutely thrilled that starting
  from the 2026 season, we will have our own cup class for the BMW M2
  Racing in the NLS. This is exactly the kind of application we
  developed our new entry-level model for. It definitely belongs on the
  Nordschleife. Now, on to the sporting side: Once again, these were two
  fantastic weeks for BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers around the
  world. In the North American SRO racing series, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and
  BMW M4 GT4 EVO continue to dominate the action. A special highlight is
  the incredible season that Random Vandals Racing is delivering in both
  the GT3 and GT4 categories. Turner Motorsport is also impressing
  across multiple series. I am also very pleased about the victory for
  FK Performance Motorsport in the prestigious ADAC GT Masters. Beyond
  that, there were many more BMW M Motorsport customers who were able to
  celebrate successes in this decisive stage of the season. I am
  delighted for each and every one of them and send my heartfelt
  congratulations. Now it’s about reaping the well-deserved rewards in
  the form of titles.”

Right in its debut season in 2026, the BMW M2 Racing will conquer the
  "Green Hell". The new entry-level race car from BMW M
  Motorsport will receive its own cup class as part of the Nürburgring
  Endurance Series (NLS). This places the car in the footsteps of its
  predecessors, the BMW M235i Racing, BMW M240i Racing, and BMW M2 CS
  Racing. The BMW M2 Racing has already passed its first test races on
  the Nordschleife, including the 24-hour race, with flying colours.
  Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, stated: "With the BMW M2
  Racing, we are continuing a proud tradition. Like its predecessors, it
  will redefine the entry-level segment. It is affordable, powerful,
  easy to maintain, and cost-efficient, with the typical M precision and
  drivability – ideal conditions for its own cup class on the
  Nordschleife." VLN Managing Director Mike Jäger added: "We
  are delighted that there will once again be a cup class for the BMW M2
  Racing in 2026. BMW cup cars have provided thrilling racing in the
  past. In 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2024, they produced the champions of
  our series." The NLS will kick off its 50th season on 14th March 2026.

At the fourth round of the ADAC GT Masters at the Salzburgring (AUT),
  BMW M Motorsport triumphed. Title contenders Tim Zimmermann (GER) and
  Leyton Fourie (RSA) won the Sunday race after Fourie had put the #11
  BMW M4 GT3 EVO on pole position. “My qualifying lap was one of the
  best I’ve ever driven,” said Fourie on Sunday. “From that moment, we
  knew we had a clear track, a good car for the race, and just needed to
  execute properly.” With their second win of the season, the
  German-South African duo from FK Performance Motorsport closed to
  within eight points of the championship lead. On Saturday, Sandro and
  Juliano Holzem (both GER) took third place in the #56 BMW M4 GT3 EVO
  of Schubert Motorsport. On Sunday they narrowly missed the podium,
  finishing fourth.

The BMW M4 GT3 EVO’s winning streak in GT World Challenge America
  continued at Barber Motorsports Park. Championship leaders Kenton Koch
  and Connor De Phillippi (both USA) celebrated their next victory in
  the #99 Random Vandals Racing car, winning Saturday’s race. Also on
  the podium were their teammates Bill Auberlen and Varun Choksey (both
  USA), who finished third in the #51 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Koch and De
  Phillippi claimed another podium on Sunday, finishing third. In the
  Pro-Am category, class leaders Robby Foley and Justin Rothberg (both
  USA) also added another win, taking the category victory on Saturday
  with the #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Turner Motorsport.

Justin Rothberg (USA) competes not only in GT World Challenge America
  but also in GT America with the #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Turner
  Motorsport. At Barber Motorsports Park, the young American scored his
  sixth win of the season. After finishing fourth on Saturday, Rothberg
  was unbeatable in Sunday’s race. With his latest victory, he further
  extended his championship lead. “The car felt really good,” Rothberg
  said afterward. “We had some understeer issues on Saturday, and the
  Turner guys took care of it completely. I just had to focus and do my
  job. I’m getting better at telling the team what I need from the car,
  but it really helps having Robby (Foley) here. He knows this BMW
  inside and out. I’m getting closer. I just try to keep learning from him.”

It was a packed weekend for GT4 America teams at Barber Motorsports
  Park (USA) – and once again a complete success for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO.
  The action kicked off Friday with the rescheduled race from Road
  America (USA), previously cancelled due to bad weather. In the overall
  and Silver class standings, Kevin Boehm and Kenton Koch (both USA) in
  the #97 Random Vandals Racing car claimed their sixth overall win of
  the season. Their teammates Sam Craven and Josh Green (both USA)
  finished second in Pro-Am, ahead of fellow BMW drivers James Walker
  Jr. and Tyler McQuarrie (both USA / BimmerWorld Racing). In the Am
  class, it was a BMW 1-2-3. Paul Sparta and Darius Trinka (both USA /
  Random Vandals Racing) won ahead of James Clay/Charlie Postins (both
  USA / BimmerWorld Racing) and Laura Hayes/Allen Patten (both USA /
  Thunder Bunny Racing).

On Saturday and Sunday, the two Barber round races followed.
  Boehm/Koch added another Silver class win (P2 overall) on Saturday. In
  Pro-Am, Craven/Green and Walker Jr./McQuarrie collected more podium
  finishes. Am class wins again went to BMW teams when Sparta/Trinka
  repeated their Friday victory on Saturday, while Hayes/Patten claimed
  Sunday’s win. Clay/Postins added a second and third place in class.

The penultimate round of GT4 Australia at The Bend (AUS) ended with
  an overall and a class win for the BMW M4 GT4. The big weekend winners
  were Ryder Quinn and Steve Jakic (both AUS). Although competing in the
  Silver-Am category rather than the top class, the duo clinched an
  outright win in the second race with the #3 BMW M4 GT4 of Thunder
  Buddies / TekworkX, thanks in large part to Quinn’s impressive
  comeback drive in the second half. It was their first overall victory
  in GT4 Australia. In the battle for the Am class title, Jacob Lawrence
  (AUS) in the #32 BMW M4 GT4 of Randall Racing claimed a class win in
  race one and finished second in race two. The season finale will be
  held at Hampton Downs (NZL) in early November.

The GT Cup Series round at Brno (CZE) featured a prominent guest
  driver, BMW works driver and this year’s Nürburgring 24h winner Jesse
  Krohn (FIN), racing the BMW M4 GT3 of Racing Trevor. He showed his
  skills by taking a commanding GT3 class win in the first sprint race,
  finishing second overall. Behind him, Jürgen Alzen (GER) in the BMW M4
  GT3 of H&R Spezialfedern finished fourth overall. In the endurance
  race, Krohn and Gregor Zsigo (SVK) secured third place in the GT3
  class. Second place went to Rudolf Beňo and Richard Gonda (both SVK)
  in the BMW M4 GT3 of Aries Racing, who led most of the race before
  being caught near the end. The second sprint race delivered two photo
  finishes and two BMW M Motorsport winners: Rudolf Beňo won the GT3
  class by 0.110 seconds, and Dobroslav Kárník (SVK) in the BMW M4 GT4
  EVO of Šenkýř Motorsport took the GT4 class win by 0.091 seconds.
  Šenkýř Motorsport also collected further GT4 podiums across the weekend.

The fifth and penultimate round of the GT World Challenge Asia 2025
  was held in Okayama, Japan. Ruan Cun Fan (CHN) and Maxime Oosten (NED)
  claimed another Silver-Am podium and defended their class championship
  lead. Driving the #89 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Team KRC, they finished third
  in class on Sunday after taking fourth on Saturday. Ruan and Oosten
  now hold a 36-point lead over their nearest rivals. The finale will
  take place in Beijing (CHN) in mid-October.

At the Nürburgring, the GT4 European Series held its penultimate
  round of the season, with three podium finishes for the BMW M4 GT4
  EVO. BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler (TUR) and teammate
  Gabriele Piana (ITA) took the #12 Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport car to
  the podium twice, third overall in race one and second in race two –
  matching their Silver class results. Viktor Bouveng and Joakim Walde
  (both SWE) also secured second place in the Pro-Am category in
  Saturday’s race with the #98 BMW M4 GT4 EVO of Schubert Motorsport.

At the end of August, teams in the Belcar Series faced their next
  endurance challenge at the 24h Zolder (BEL). BMW M Motorsport teams
  competed with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO and other BMW race cars – and found
  success. In the GTS class, Hamofa Motorsport secured second place with
  the BMW M4 GT4 EVO, while BMS Motorsport took third with another BMW
  M4 GT4. Additional class wins followed as Stevens Motorsport triumphed
  in the SS category with the BMW M2, IR Pwrd by GRT Motorsport won the
  CS class with a BMW G20 CS, and BMW Team Van der Horst celebrated a
  double win in the CC class with their BMW 325i.
