The BMW Group and its joint venture Encory
  are building a Cell Recycling Competence Centre (CRCC) for battery
  cells in Kirchroth, in the Straubing-Bogen district of Lower Bavaria,
  where it will implement a process referred to as “direct recycling”.
  This innovative procedure enables residual materials from battery cell
  production, as well as whole battery cells, to be mechanically
  dismantled into their valuable components. The recovered raw materials
  are then directly reused in pilot production of battery cells at the
  company’s own Battery Cell Competence Centres.

“The new Cell Recycling Competence Centre brings another element to
  our in-house expertise: From development and pilot production to
  recycling, we are creating a closed loop for battery cells,” says
  Markus Fallböhmer, SVP Battery Production at BMW AG, “taking advantage
  of the short distances between our Competence Centres in Bavaria.” The
  BMW Group is investing around 10 million euros in construction of the
  new Competence Centre. Installation work at the building is already
  scheduled to begin in the second half of 2025. Once completed,
  validation of the recycling method in near-series processes will get underway.

Battery cell raw materials – primarily lithium and cobalt, but also
  graphite, manganese, nickel and copper – are among the main cost
  factors in cell production. Responsible use of these resources is
  essential from both environmental and economic perspectives. “The
  direct recycling will help reducing the costs for our battery cell
  pilot line”, explains Fallböhmer. Unlike conventional methods, the
  main characteristic of direct recycling is that raw materials from
  battery cells are not reverted to their original state, but are
  instead fed back “directly” into the cell production cycle. This
  method dispenses with the previously common energy-intensive chemical
  or thermal processing. The recycling method was developed by BMW Group
  experts at the Competence Centres in Munich and Parsdorf. At the new
  CRCC, it will be implemented on a larger scale and, once the processes
  are finalised, battery cell material in the mid-double-digit tonne
  range can be recycled per year.

The BMW Group consolidates its battery cell expertise at its
  Competence Centres in Munich and Parsdorf. The Battery Cell Competence
  Centre (BCCC) in the north of Munich offers state-of-the-art labs and
  research facilities for developing the battery cells for
  next-generation high-voltage batteries and producing them in small
  quantities. The most promising battery cell from the BCCC will be
  scaled up for series processes on a pilot line at the Cell
  Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf. Once completed,
  recycling of surplus material from pilot production in Parsdorf will
  take place at the new Competence Centre in Kirchroth. The recovered
  raw materials will then be reused in cell production in Parsdorf. This
  ensures short distances between all Competence Centres and prevents
  valuable raw materials from being lost. Following on from the BCCC and
  CMCC, the CRCC thus represents the next step in the BMW Group’s
  battery cell strategy on the road to the circular economy.

The new CRCC, spanning an area of 2,200 m², will be integrated into
  the expansion of an existing building in the Kirchroth-Nord industrial
  park, near Straubing. Electrical energy from the discharged cells will
  be captured in energy storage systems within the building and used to
  operate the recycling systems. The energy concept will be rounded out
  by photovoltaic systems installed on the roof of the building. While
  the intellectual property for the recycling method is fully owned by
  the BMW Group – the Competence Centre will be built and operated by
  Encory GmbH. As a joint venture of the BMW Group and Interzero Group,
  Encory develops and implements logistics and consulting solutions in
  areas such as collection, recycling, and remanufacturing of vehicle
  components. Both partners hold a 50% stake in the company. Around 20
  people will be employed in the new Competence Center.

The BMW Group views the circular economy as one of the key issues in
  designing more resource-efficient vehicles. The premise is to optimize
  the circularity of materials. This means resources are not lost, but
  retain their value for long-term use. The BMW Group applies the
  principles of Re:Think, Re:Duce, Re:Use and Re:Cycle. From vehicle
  design and production, to recycling and reuse, everything is geared
  towards ensuring cars can serve as a source of raw materials for new
  vehicles at the end of their use phase. Recycling focuses, in
  particular, on the use of innovative methods to recover high-voltage
  batteries from electrified vehicles.
