Petrucci, well known by his nickname “Petrux,” is one of the most
  experienced international riders. He raced full-time in MotoGP from
  2012 to 2021, with additional appearances in the following two years.
  He also spent a season in MotoAmerica and competed in the Dakar Rally,
  where he impressively won a stage. Petrucci joined WorldSBK in 2023.
  In his 93 WorldSBK races to date with the private Barni Spark Racing
  Team, “Petrux” has claimed no fewer than 20 podium finishes, including
  three victories. In the current season, he has already stood on the
  podium seven times and currently sits third in the championship
  standings behind leader Razgatlioglu and Nicolò Bulega (ITA). He also
  leads the Independent Riders’ standings by a wide margin.

“We are very pleased to welcome Danilo Petrucci to our BMW Motorrad
  Motorsport family in 2026,” said Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad
  Motorsport. “We are confident that we can continue our success story
  in WorldSBK with Danilo. His move to BMW Motorrad Motorsport is more
  than just a new contract – it is a recognition of his hard work
  throughout his career. Danilo has more than earned his place as a
  factory rider, and we are convinced that his passion and skill will
  help lead our team into the future. His impressive career across
  various motorsport disciplines is a testament to his talent and
  ability to perform under the most demanding conditions. Danilo has not
  only excelled on the track but has also won the hearts of fans with
  his unique character and authenticity. He’s a true fighter who never
  gives up, and his positive attitude inspires not only his team but
  everyone who follows him. We look forward to the challenges and
  successes ahead, and we are proud to soon have Petrux as a member of
  our BMW Motorrad Motorsport family.”

Petrucci said: “I’m really happy to join BMW Motorrad Motorsport for
  the next season in World Superbikes and proud that I will ride the
  bike that currently bears the number one. It was my target to ride a
  factory bike because I really want to fight for the World Championship
  title. So I think that this is the step that I needed to get in the
  position to achieve that goal. I can’t wait to join the team and I
  want to thank everyone at BMW and all those people at home who support
  me. I also want to thank the Barni Spark Racing Team for these three
  years in World Superbikes and that they enabled me to get into a
  factory team, which has been my target.”
