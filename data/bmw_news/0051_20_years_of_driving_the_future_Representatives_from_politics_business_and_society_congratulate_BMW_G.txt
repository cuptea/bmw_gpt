As BMW Group Plant Leipzig celebrates its
  20

anniversary, a stream of high-ranking representatives
  from politics, business and civil society today came to the plant to
  offer their congratulations on its two-decade success story. Among
  them were Barbara Meyer, Secretary of State for the Free State of
  Saxony, and the Lord Mayor of Leipzig Burkhard Jung. Both highlighted
  the plant’s importance for the economic development of the
  Leipzig/Halle region, but also for Saxony more generally. Milan
  Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible
  for Production, emphasised Leipzig’s pioneering spirit and extreme
  flexibility as factors in its success.

Since 2005 Plant Leipzig has produced almost 4,000,000 vehicles and
  received over €5.6 billion so far in investment from the BMW Group,
  creating 6,680 jobs with BMW. More than 11,600 people in total
  currently work at the site, which has undergone constant improvement
  over the years to enhance efficiency, flexibility and innovation, and
  prepare for the future. Today Leipzig is the only BMW Group plant to
  produce BMW and MINI vehicles side by side on the same production line
  – to customer specification and with the full range of drive options,
  from combustion engine to hybrid or electric drive.

Capacity utilisation is currently high at Plant Leipzig, with
  round-the-clock production in three shifts. This year the plant is
  expecting to achieve a new production record, its last being in 2024,
  when output totalled 246,195 vehicles. In 2025 Plant Leipzig will once
  again be a key contributor to the over 1,000,000 vehicles made at BMW
  Group plants in Germany. These account for roughly one in every four
  of all vehicles made in this country by the various manufacturers
  operating here.

Milan Nedeljkovic, Member of the Board of Management for Production,
  sees Leipzig truly ready for the future: “Leipzig is synonymous with
  innovation and digitalisation – and has proved it time and again over
  the last 20 years. Because of its flexibility and efficiency, it is a
  key cornerstone in what we do, as we believe in Germany’s strength
  within our global production network.”

Alongside flexibility and efficiency,
  Plant Director Petra Peterhänsel emphasised another key factor in
  Leipzig’s success: its capacity for innovation. “Here in Leipzig, we
  have paved the way for many innovations. One was the first electric
  BMW – the BMW i3. Another is the use of hydrogen, which we are already
  applying in intralogistics and will soon utilise in the paint shop
  too.” Looking ahead, Peterhänsel commented: “We are currently
  investing hundreds of millions in extending and modernising our
  systems and structures to prepare our plant for forthcoming vehicle
  generations. This will set the course for our future and keep Leipzig competitive.”

Saxony’s Minister President Michael Kretschmer emphazises: “BMW in
  Leipzig has completely reshaped our economic history. BMW has always
  been focused on technical progress and people’s real needs, on the
  cars they truly want to drive. If it continues on this path, it will
  remain at the forefront in the future as well.”

Lord Mayor Burkhard Jung highlighted the plant’s importance for the
  city of Leipzig: “We are very pleased indeed that the largest
  industrial employer in our city is looking back on 20 years of
  success. while also looking forward to a bright future. It will
  benefit not just employees, but our city as a whole, of course.
  Congratulations! And here’s to another 20 years of successful collaboration.”
