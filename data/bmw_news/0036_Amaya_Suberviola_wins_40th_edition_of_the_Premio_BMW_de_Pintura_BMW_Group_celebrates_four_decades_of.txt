  it is a necessity. It is the soul of a people. It is what unites us
  when everything seems to divide us," he said.

  cultural effervescence of 1980s Spain, the era in which the award was
  born, and defended the value of creativity as a hallmark of identity:
  "La Movida did not end in the 1980s. It is revived every time an
  artist dares to challenge the status quo, and every time Spain
  reinvents itself. Because creativity here is not taught, it is
  breathed," she said.
