In preparation for the 2022 season of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad Motorsport carried out its first winter test. The two BMW teams – BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – took to the track in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, this week.

In the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Michael van der Mark (NED)
  continued his work on the BMW M 1000 RR as he looks to take another
  step forward next season after one win and a further two podiums in
  2021. Scott Redding (GBR) used the test days to familiarise himself
  with his future bike and team. The Brit had gained his first
  experience on his new bike during a private test in Estoril (POR) last
  week. The focus there was on getting to know the bike and recording
  the ergometry. The findings from the test were implemented quickly and
  the modified parts and new components were already available by the
  time he arrived at the Jerez de la Frontera test.

With the two riders, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team tested engine
  specifications for 2022, as well as chassis modifications. The direct
  competitive comparison allows the team to determine the work direction
  in preparation for the next test in the new year.

The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team is also at Jerez de la Frontera
  with its two new riders. After Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Loris Baz
  (FRA) visited the team headquarters in Germany in November, they began
  the test work together at the racetrack. Laverty, who was heavily
  involved in the development of the BMW M 1000 RR, will be racing with
  the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in his third season as a BMW works
  driver. Baz is already familiar with the BMW S 1000 RR, on which he
  rode in the WorldSBK in 2018, and uses the test to learn more about
  the M RR.

“There have been a lot of new things at this test. In general, it has
  been important to test with all four riders, including the two new
  additions Baz and Redding, before Christmas. It was good to have all
  four riders on the same bike on the same race track. We brought a lot
  of new test items that we either confirmed or evaluated with all four
  of the in order to get the right direction. With two new riders you of
  course first to get used to the way they give their feedback and how
  to transfer their comments but we managed that very well. We then also
  compared this feedback with that given by van der Mark and Laverty who
  already knew the bike very well. We have ticked all boxes in our test
  programme but maybe might do some further laps tomorrow. We gathered a
  huge amount of information and this is now to be analysed. Overall, we
  found very good directions and in general, I am very satisfied. We
  take a lot of positives back home. Now we will have a well-deserved
  Christmas break but then we will continue to intensively prepare for
  the season. We are very optimistic looking forward.”

“It has been a successful test for both sides of the pit box.
  We have a new rider with Scott. He had a lot of things to work through
  but most importantly for him was to find that comfortable setting
  feeling with the bike. I am really pleased about his work ethic in the
  pit box. He has put a lot of laps in and he acclimatised very well. On
  Michael’s side, we worked on similar development parts to what Scott
  has and he has been working through that very well as well. Comparing
  both riders’ feedback it is very similar and  I am very pleased about
  that. I think it is proving that the set-up direction we are going
  with the BMW M 1000 RR is aligned between both riders which is very
  important. Equally important is that we got new team-members within
  the group and I am really pleased to see how all these guys are
  working together. There has been a lot of overlapping, a lot of
  chassis changes, a lot of engine changes and everybody has been
  working as a group, so I applaud all the team and all the guys working
  very closely together. Overall I think we can leave the test here at
  Jerez with our heads held up high, we have done a good job and we can
  go into the Christmas break with a lot of confidence and get ready for
  our next test in the new year.”

“It
  was good to have a test even if it was so late in the year. We had a
  lot of new components and items to try on the bike. At this test we
  barely played around with the set-up of the bike, we mainly tried new
  parts to figure out what brings improvement and what does not. We need
  to get some ideas and start producing the new things. It has been a
  really good test and I am really happy with a lot of new things. It
  was great to gather good information and now I am looking forward to a
  short Christmas break.”

“It has been the first test for the new season and the first
  time for us to be at the race track with the big team. I want to take
  this opportunity to say a big thank you to Jürgen Röder, who made it
  possible for us to now compete as a two-rider team. He will attend
  many races next year and we are looking forward to that. We have a lot
  of new people with us, also the riders are partly new for us. Of
  course we have known both for many years. Loris has already raced for
  our team and I have also known Eugene for quite some time. Both did a
  great job at the test. But not only that, it was also important for me
  to gel with the new members as a team and to get used to each other.
  That worked very well. With new people, for example from England and
  France, our team has become more international after being a more or
  less German squad in the past. Like at every other team, English is
  now our team language. The collaboration in the combination with SMR
  and Bonovo action also works very well. There are always a lot of
  things to try and when time allows we share this between us. The test
  has been very positive in all aspects, we are also happy with the lap
  times. But we still have some things to find and work to do.”

“I
  already met the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in November when we went
  to Germany and spent a weekend together with the guys. They invited us
  all there and it was so nice to meet each other away from the track
  because sometimes you only meet the guys in a work environment. So to
  go there, have some beers and relax away from the track and made me
  feel at home straight away. The first test days with the team have
  been very positive. I felt comfortable on the bike immediately after
  the first couple of exits on day one. I feel good in braking which is
  an area I am always working on. I am happy with the progress we are
  making. There is still work to do to improve our turning in the long
  corners compared to the other BMW riders but I am happy that we are
  right there in the mix. There is a really good atmosphere in the box,
  I get on very well with Loris. He is a fast guy and that’s important,
  to have a fast team-mate to push you. We work together well and all
  the guys are experienced as well. It’s great crew and I think we have
  a good year ahead of us.”

“I am happy
  to be back with BMW and about the opportunity to be back in WorldSBK.
  I was really looking forward to that test to have a first impression.
  A December test is never the most crucial one of the season but it’s
  really important for getting to know the team, to meet the people and
  for the feeling you are going into the winter with. The test was a lot
  of work, we did a lot of laps. Also, I was back on the bike after
  nearly three months and it is never easy when you jump on a bike that
  is completely different. The test was about understanding how the bike
  works and also to try to give the best input based on the differences
  of all the bikes I know. I have riden a lot of bikes in WorldSBK so I
  was trying to adapt to the bike and at the same time give the right
  input on what we can improve on that bike. The M RR has a lot of
  strong points, we just need to put them together to get a bike that
  works well from a riding side. When you start working with a new bike,
  you have to switch from one riding style to another but we did a good
  job, completing over 150 laps. Yes, I am happy. We tried some new
  parts for next year and mainly a lot of things on the electronics, and
  with every run we went faster and I felt a bit more confident on the
  bike. I am satisfied with the job so far.”
