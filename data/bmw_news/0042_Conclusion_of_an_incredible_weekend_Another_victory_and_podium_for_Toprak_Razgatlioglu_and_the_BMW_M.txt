The second race weekend of the 2024 WorldSBK at Barcelona turned into a success story for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Following the pole position and the celebrated first joint victory on Saturday, Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK had plenty to cheer about on Sunday as well. Razgatlioglu claimed his next victory in the Superpole Race in the morning and followed it up with a third-place finish on the podium in the second race.

The Superpole Race on Sunday morning kept everyone on the edge of
  their seats. Starting from pole position, Razgatlioglu initially
  dropped to fifth place. In the fourth of ten laps, he moved up to
  fourth place, and in the following lap, he made a sensational
  manoeuvre to regain the lead. He then battled with Andrea Iannone (ITA
  / Ducati) and Alvaro Bautista (ESP / Ducati) with several lead changes
  for the victory. In the last corner, Razgatlioglu once again executed
  an impressive manoeuvre and clinched his second victory of the weekend.

Razgatlioglu also started the second main race on Sunday afternoon
  from pole position. After the start, he was briefly in fourth place,
  but it didn’t take long for him to work his way into the podium
  positions. He stayed close behind the leading Ducati riders Bautista
  and Nicolò Bulega (ITA) for a long time, but this time it wasn’t
  enough for a final sprint back to the very top. Thus, Razgatlioglu
  concluded his extremely successful Barcelona weekend with a
  third-place finish on the podium. After the finish, he embraced
  teammate van der Mark, who completed the strong team result in fourth
  place. In the Superpole Race, van der Mark finished sixth.

The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team returned to the top ten on Sunday.
  Both riders, Gerloff and Scott Redding (GBR), engaged in a long duel
  with several position changes. In the end, Gerloff prevailed in tenth
  place, with Redding following just 0.4 seconds behind in eleventh place.

The third round of the 2024 WorldSBK season will be held from 19th to
  21st April at Assen (NED).

“Before we came here, we hoped to claim another podium. That
  was the target after a good test last week but we also saw that the
  Ducatis were extremely strong. To come away four trophies, pole
  position, two wins and one podium, is absolutely magnificent. I am
  speechless, honestly. It is extremely good for the project and I am
  even looking further forward to the rest of the season which gives me
  more confidence. Not just Toprak, also Mickey did a fantastic job,
  with fourth in qualifying yesterday, sixth in this morning’s Superpole
  Race and a very strong fourth position in main race two. It’s well
  deserved. I just enjoy the moment right now. It is highly emotional,
  this weekend had only ups. We’ve had enough downs in the past years so
  it’s good to get through the valley of tears. On the Bonovo side, the
  weekend was more difficult but in the final race, Garrett and Scott
  were in the ball park so we can build from there and like I said,
  there are better races to come. Overall, this weekend leaves me
  overwhelmed and very pleased.”

“I am really happy for this moment
  because this is a dream. Not only for me, for BMW and the team. We
  claimed two victories at Barcelona, and for me it has been an amazing
  weekend. Especially today’s last race was a very hard, the pace was
  really strong. Alvaro started normal and then pushed very hard. I just
  tried to follow him but I felt a lot of spinning and closed the gas
  because in a 20-lap race you need a good tyre with good grid for the
  last five laps. But in general, I am very happy because we were on the
  podium in all three races, including two wins. Especially the
  Superpole Race was incredible, when I passed Alvaro in the last
  corner. I think this is in my top three overtakes of my career. I am
  also very happy for BMW. We are coming step by step and I think we
  will be stronger on the other race tracks. Everyone is very happy and
  will now work even harder. We have a very good package. We are coming,
  we are not so far and this year I think we can get many wins and I
  hope that we will be World Champions. I hope!”

“Honestly I think for the whole team it
  has been a fantastic weekend. This was one of our worst tracks and to
  see Toprak getting two wins, another podium and the pole position, was
  great, and I had some really strong results this weekend, too. So I am
  really happy, really satisfied with the improvement on the bikes.
  Honestly, to finish P6 this morning was quite good, but to finish
  fourth in race two was a big relief for me. It’s nice to see that I
  get back on a really good level and I’m just really happy with the
  whole weekend. I think it gives the whole team a big boost, and also
  for me, for the next race at Assen which I am really looking forward
  to. At least now we arrive there knowing how good the package can be.”

“So we are at the end of the weekend. I am not
  going to lie, I was hoping and expecting a better weekend than it was.
  We just struggled a bit with some things. I feel like I struggle with
  some riding stuff on my side and also I had some issues with some
  setting stuff on the bike side. It wasn’t easy, there weren’t clear
  answers and I am kind of leaving the weekend thinking that we don’t
  have a clear answer of what we were missing. We were just missing
  something that’s not small. We just try to regroup over the next weeks
  and come back to Assen and have a strong race there.”

“The weather today was unexpected. We had some
  rain this morning so we did not ride in the warm up. The Superpole
  Race was quite good for me. I felt pretty good so I managed to gain
  some confidence for race two. There, I was really motivated to finish
  in the top ten. That was my goal. I came off the start, I came
  together with Dominique Aegerter so I lost some positions. Then in
  turn three, Iker Lecouna just ran me off the track, so I lost again
  some positions and then we kind of settled; the group was trying to
  save the tyres. Then there was a big crash in turn one. I am happy
  that they both walked away okay from it. There was a gap I had to try
  to close and I used my tyre more. I felt good on the bike, that was
  the main thing. I felt that I could actually push the bike and start
  to race and have confidence. On the last few laps, the tyre dropped
  more. I finished 11th in the end; the top ten was there. So I was
  happy, because Barcelona is one of the worst tracks in the calendar
  for me and I came away with confidence which is the first time in
  three years that this has happened, so I look forward to the next round.”
