It's that time of year again - Christmas is almost here! The new MINI
  family has something for everyone this festive season, including the
  distinctive MINI Cooper Convertible and the versatile MINI Countryman.
  The MINI Cooper Convertible S is the ideal companion for excursions
  through snow-covered winter landscapes. You can enjoy the fresh air
  and sunshine with the top down, true to the motto "Always
  Open". The Convertible also gives you that typical MINI go-kart
  feeling with its 150 kW/204 hp output and agile handling.

The MINI Countryman S ALL4 is the perfect choice for those with a
  need for more space. With a luggage compartment capacity ranging from
  450 litres to 1,450 litres, the compact SUV not only offers plenty of
  room for ski equipment and luggage, but also a spacious interior that
  comfortably accommodates families. The MINI Countryman handles winter
  conditions with ease and gets you to your destination safely thanks to
  its four-wheel drive. The MINI Countryman's high level of occupant and
  pedestrian safety was confirmed in early December when the MINI
  Countryman received the highest possible five-star rating in the Euro
  NCAP crash test.

MINI can look back on an eventful year. With the MINI Cooper 3-door,
  MINI Cooper 5-door, MINI Cooper Convertible and MINI Countryman, four
  models have been completely renewed. The family was joined by a new
  member: the MINI Aceman. The progressive crossover model closes the
  gap between the MINI Cooper and the MINI Countryman. The MINI Aceman
  is offered exclusively as an all-electric model, while the MINI Cooper
  family is available with a combustion engine, and the MINI Cooper SE
  and E are also available with all-electric drive. The MINI Countryman
  offers a particularly wide choice of powertrains, with five different
  electric and combustion drives.

Numerous awards worldwide underline the success of the new MINI
  models. The MINI Cooper was awarded the "Goldenes Lenkrad"
  (Golden Steering Wheel) in Germany and was also named "Best
  Imported Vehicle in Japan".  The MINI Cooper was named "Car
  of the Year 2024" by The Sun newspaper in the UK, while the MINI
  Countryman was named "Small Premium SUV of the Year" by Auto
  Express magazine.
