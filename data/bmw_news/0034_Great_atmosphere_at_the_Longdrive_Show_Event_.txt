  celebrate “Launch Control – A Longdrive Competition presented by BMW
  & Martin Borgmeier” +++ Successful premiere at the 35

BMW International Open +++

The first round of the 35

BMW
  International Open ended with a real bang. Right after the last putt,
  the 18

green in front of the grandstand transformed into
  a Longdrive arena. At “Launch Control – A Longdrive Competition
  presented by BMW & Martin Borgmeier”, for the first time as part
  of a DP World Tour event, six top-class Longdrive athletes, both men
  and women, competed against each other in an adrenaline-charged show match.

German Longdrive World Champion Martin Borgmeier prevailed among the
  men against Ryan “The Canadian Lumberjack” Gregnol (CAN) and Sam Judah
  (USA). Borgmeier won the final against Gregnol with a drive of 424
  metres, however the Canadian had shown the longest hit of the day in
  the preliminary round with 427 metres.

Among the women, Cassandra Meyer (USA) (322 metres) defeated her
  compatriot Gabi Powel and the local favourite and European Amateur
  Long Drive Champion Sonya Knebel. The real winners however were the
  enthusiastic fans who enjoyed and celebrated a different kind of golf
  experience and a spectacular competition.
