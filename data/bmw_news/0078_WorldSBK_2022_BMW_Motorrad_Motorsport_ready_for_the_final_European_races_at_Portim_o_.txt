The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has moved on from the difficult race
  weekend at Barcelona (ESP). Scott Redding (GBR) is looking instead to
  back up the success he had enjoyed previously, while team-mate Michael
  van der Mark (NED) is hoping to take the next step towards the front
  of the field. The team and van der Mark have fond memories of
  Portimão, where the Dutchman last year won the Superpole race on the
  Sunday morning.

The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team finished in the top ten in all
  Barcelona three races, and is now determined to improve on that
  performance at Portimão, at a circuit that ought to be more suited to
  the BMW M 1000 RR. Portimão is a home event for Eugene Laverty (IRL),
  who has lived just a few kilometres from the racetrack for a number of
  years now. He and team-mate Loris Baz (FRA) have their sights set on
  more strong results for the team.

“After Barcelona, where we fell short of our own expectations
  at times, we now want to start afresh at Portimão. In the final races
  in Europe, we need to carry on where we left off at Magny-Cours. It is
  also important to significantly cut the gap to the front-runners with
  all four riders. The character of the track at Portimão has suited us
  in the past, and we hope that will be the case again this year. In the
  short time since Barcelona, we have worked hard to analyse where our
  weaknesses are and how we can solve them. We want to bring the
  European leg of the season to a close on a high so that we can then
  carry the momentum into the final spurt overseas.”

“For me,
  Portimão is a good circuit, very technical. I quite enjoy riding it
  because of the character, the up and down, the long corners, the slow
  corners, so I am very excited to go there. Obviously, after a tough
  weekend at Barcelona, it would be nice to try to get back to where we
  were, but again it’s another new track for me with BMW, so I don’t
  know the potential. I know BMW had a good result there last year in
  the rain-mixed conditions so let’s see what we can do. It would be
  nice to get back to the top five, and if we are feeling really strong
  it would be nice to try and get a podium again or at least fight for
  it. I am looking forward to it.”

“I
  am looking forward to Portimão; it is one of my favourite WorldSBK
  tracks on the calendar. It’s a unique track and I am always looking
  forward to getting there. After Barcelona, our main target is to have
  a problem-free weekend. I still need to ride as much as possible.
  There were some positives at the Barcelona weekend and I am pretty
  sure that if all goes well we will be a lot faster at Portimão. Like I
  said, it is one of my favourite tracks and that always helps. I can’t
  wait to get started and see how it goes.”

“Portimão
  has always been one of my favourites since day one. Last year there
  was a turning point of coming back with my three podiums there.
  Barcelona was tough, but I managed to bring the best possible home.
  Portimão should suit us much more and I really hope to be in the top
  five there. If I can qualify better, I’m sure my races in Portugal can
  be strong.”

“The
  Portimão circuit has always been special to me having won there on
  both Supersport and Superbike machines. I now live nearby so it is
  truly a home race. Last time out at Catalunya I was pleased to return
  inside the top ten and that will be the aim again at Portimão. As
  riders we all love naturally undulating tracks and Portimão is just
  that, a real rollercoaster. During practice we’ll aim to improve our
  outright pace as I’ve been lacking in Superpole lately. If we can
  qualify better then it puts us in the mix for the early laps of the races.”
