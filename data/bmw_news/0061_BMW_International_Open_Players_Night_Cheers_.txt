There is one established tradition at the BMW International Open, the likes of which you won’t find at any other tournament on the DP World Tour: Friday evening ends in style with the Players’ Night. The pros and other invited guests enjoyed a rustic Bavarian evening at popular Munich club P1.

Dressed in lederhosen and dirndls, the stars and their partners
  relaxed in Bavarian comfort and took on traditional challenges like
  the “Hau den Lukas” test of strength. A Players’ Night would not be a
  Players’ Night without the traditional tapping of the barrel. This
  honour went to European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald (ENG) and Marcel
  Siem (GER), who grew up in Munich.
