The Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026
  will be awarded to Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. The prize honours
  one of the most influential contemporary artists, who will be
  represented in Germany for the first time with a solo exhibition. His
  works, which range from sculpture and installation to conceptual
  practice, are characterised by sharp humour, bitter seriousness, and a
  profound reflection on social structures. Since its launch in 2000,
  this prestigious award has recognised artistic positions that have had
  a decisive influence on contemporary art and presented them to a broad
  public in Berlin. BMW has been the exclusive partner of this unique
  initiative since 2006. The exhibition accompanying the Preis der
  Nationalgalerie will open at the Neue Nationalgalerie during Berlin
  Art Week in September 2026.

“Back in 2016, Maurizio Cattelan gave a fully electric BMW i3 a
  spaghetti-themed wrap as part of our partnership with ‘Rencontres
  d’Arles’. Creative freedom has defined BMW’s cultural engagement for
  over 50 years, through hundreds of collaborations across the globe.
  And it is precisely this freedom that Cattelan continues to explore to
  its fullest – with wit, intelligence, and often a sharp critical edge.
  Whether art reflects our existence or opens up new perspectives has
  been discussed since the Romantic era. In Cattelan’s case, it is
  always both. Social relevance and creative excellence come together
  here, just as they do with the Preis der Nationalgalerie, which BMW
  has supported for two decades. We congratulate Maurizio Cattelan on
  being awarded the 2026 Preis der Nationalgalerie and on his upcoming
  solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie,” says

BMW and Maurizio Cattelan collaborated at “Rencontres d’Arles” in
  2016; together with photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, Cattelan created a
  special project based around the fully electric BMW i3. The so-called

featured the vehicle completely covered in spaghetti-themed
  foil – a humorous and conceptual work that playfully addressed issues
  of art, consumption, and sustainability.

Since the early 1990s, Maurizio Cattelan (born 1960 in Padua) has
  been one of the defining voices in international art. His iconic works
  – including “La Nona Ora” (1999), a figure of Pope John Paul II struck
  by a meteorite, “Him” (2001), a praying schoolboy with the face of
  Adolf Hitler, and “Untitled” (2003), an animatronic sculpture based on
  the protagonist of Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum” – show how Cattelan
  uses shock, irritation and moral ambivalence to raise central
  questions of our time: guilt, responsibility, power, and collective
  trauma. Cattelan's artistic practice is permeated by an aesthetic of
  “comic existentialism” – a combination of humour and tragedy, irony
  and profundity, that makes his works appear both accessible and
  enigmatic. With this exhibition, Maurizio Cattelan returns to Berlin,
  where he co-curated the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006.

The expert jury for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 is made up of
  outstanding international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the
  Pinault Collection, Paris) and Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation
  Beyeler, Basel) as well as Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue
  Nationalgalerie). In addition to the expert jurors, the curators of
  the Nationalgalerie and the members of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie
  were also eligible to submit nominations.

say: „Nearly two decades ago, as
  co-curator of the 4th Berlin Biennale, Maurizio Cattelan played a
  decisive role in establishing Berlin’s international standing as a
  centre of contemporary art. Twenty years on, a solo exhibition at the
  Neue Nationalgalerie offers an opportunity to revisit and reflect on
  this formative influence within a new social and cultural context.

Cattelan’s practice engages enduring themes such as power, religion,
  death, humour and memory – concerns that resonate with particular
  force in Berlin, a city profoundly shaped by its complex history. As
  an Italian artist with an international career, he brings a distinctly
  European perspective to questions of identity, responsibility and
  collective remembrance. His works invite us to confront history in
  ways that are simultaneously provocative, critical and poetic.

In Germany, where forms of remembrance are currently being
  re-examined –  between the last generations with direct connections to
  the NS era and a younger generation informed by global perspectives –
  Cattelan’s art acquires renewed significance. His iconic gestures,
  oscillating between exaggeration, irony, and pain, challenge the
  rituals of commemoration, evoke both history and its narratives, and
  open new vantage points on contemporary social debates. In a time of
  increasing political polarisation, his art can encourage us to view
  remembrance not as compulsion or obligation, but as a vital and
  relevant engagement with the present and the future.

Cattelan’s ironic questioning of authority and “truth” carries
  particular urgency today. At a moment when institutions – museums,
  politics and the media – are re-evaluating their credibility and
  social roles, he scrutinizes structures of power both within and
  beyond the art world, always without a moralizing tone. His works
  provoke reflection on personal responsibility, historical
  representation and the limits of institutional critique and authority.
  In an atmosphere of political and social hardening, Cattelan’s
  subversive humour acts as a liberating force. He reminds us that
  provocation and wit are not expressions of cynicism but forms of
  resistance and constructive reflection. Particularly in the German
  context, where public discourse often carries a strong moral charge,
  his art opens up spaces for thought beyond outrage and polarization.
  Cattelan is not an artist of straightforwardness. His strength lies in
  embracing ambiguity, exposing contradictions and posing new questions.
  This willingness to inhabit the in-between generates productive
  tension and reminds us that ambiguity is not a weakness but a
  precondition for critical awareness.

The Neue Nationalgalerie, with its iconic building by Mies van der
  Rohe, is ideally suited as a place situated between modernity, the
  20th and 21st centuries, and the present day, to showcase Cattelan's
  work in all its complexity – as a mirror and commentary on our time.”

says: “With Maurizio Cattelan, we are
  honouring an artist who addresses social issues with sharpness, wit
  and profundity. The fact that his first major solo exhibition in
  Germany is being shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie underlines the
  Preis der Nationalgalerie’s claim to bring artistic positions of
  international significance to Berlin.”

Maurizio Cattelan’s exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie will be
  curated by Lisa Botti, curator at the Neue Nationalgalerie, with Klaus
  Biesenbach, director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, and will open in
  September 2026 during Berlin Art Week with an award ceremony.

The Preis der Nationalgalerie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary
  this year, has established itself over the decades as one of the most
  important art prizes, showing its winners to make a significant impact
  both nationally and internationally. Today, the Preis der
  Nationalgalerie continues to be a tribute that reflects the vital
  international art scene and transfer it into an institutional context.
  In this spirit, the prize in 2026 will remain flexible and open for
  changes and will be continued in a new format for the first time at
  Neue Nationalgalerie. From 2026, artists who set international
  standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively presented in
  Berlin, will be honoured through a solo exhibition. The change of
  location places contemporary art in dialogue with the collection of
  the Neue Nationalgalerie and its history. The iconic hall of the Mies
  van der Rohe building provides the ideal setting for a concise,
  artistic setting. The exhibition is made possible by the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie.
