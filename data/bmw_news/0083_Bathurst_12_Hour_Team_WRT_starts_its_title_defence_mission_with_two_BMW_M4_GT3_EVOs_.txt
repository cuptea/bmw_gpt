In 2025, the Bathurst 12 Hour was the perfect start to a great IGTC
  season. BMW M Motorsport celebrated a 1-2 finish in Australia and then
  won three of the other four IGTC events. The manufacturers' title and
  the drivers' title for Kelvin van der Linde were the well-deserved
  reward. The next attempt follows in 2026. BMW M Motorsport will line
  up at Bathurst with two BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars from Team WRT in the top
  category and one car from Team KRC in the Bronze class.

Last year's winner and IGTC Drivers' Champion Kelvin van der Linde
  will line up in the #32 Team WRT car with fellow South African Jordan
  Pepper and 2024 IGTC Drivers' Champion Charles Weerts (BEL). This will
  be Pepper's first works outing for BMW M Motorsport. Valentino Rossi
  returns to Bathurst in the number 46. He will be joined in the race by
  last year's winner Augusto Farfus and Raffaele Marciello (SUI). In the
  Bronze class, the Chinese team KRC will start with BMW M works driver
  Max Hesse, Maxime Oosten (NED) and Ruan Cunfan (CHN).

"We have a dream line-up with Jordan and Charles in a dream team
  like WRT. I celebrated many great successes with Charles last season,
  and I've known Jordan very well since I was a teenager. Defending the
  title will be a big challenge, but I will do everything I can to
  finish on top once again in one of the most special races of the year
  and thus enable Jordan to do what I did a year ago: win Bathurst on my
  debut with BMW M Motorsport. Winning 2025 with my brother Sheldon and
  Augusto was one of the proudest moments of my career."

"I'm really excited and proud to be coming to Bathurst with BMW M
  Motorsport and Team WRT. What a place for my first works race! My
  memories of the race are very special. I won there in 2020 and I
  really enjoy the track, the place and the atmosphere. Of course, we
  also have pressure, because we are coming there as defending
  champions, but I have two great teammates in Kelvin and Charles. We
  get on very well on a professional and personal level. Driving with
  Kelvin is something very special for me. We've known each other for so
  long and complement each other very well."

"Bathurst is one of the coolest and most challenging races of the
  year. I'm really looking forward to returning there after my victory
  last year. Back then, I was still racing against Valentino and
  Raffaele in the sister car. Now I will do everything I can to stand on
  the top step of the podium with them again."

"I'm really looking forward to returning to Bathurst. It's one of
  the best races of the season. The track is fantastic. When I started
  racing, Bathurst was at the top of my wish list. Now I've been here
  three times and enjoy it every time. Last year the race went great and
  we finished second. The podium is the goal again this time. With
  Raffaele and Augusto, I have two stellar teammates from whom I can
  learn a lot and with whom I will certainly have a lot of fun."

"I'm
  really looking forward to my debut at Bathurst. I've only heard good
  things about the track and the event so far and can hardly wait to do
  my first laps there. Before that, I'll certainly be spending a lot of
  time in the simulator to familiarise myself with the 'mini
  Nordschleife' as much as possible. Starting the 2026 season with a
  second highlight race after Daytona is absolutely fantastic. I'm
  looking forward to the KRC team, where I'll also see some familiar
  faces, and I think we can play a good role in our class."
