The BMW Motorrad factory riders put down some markers in the free
  practice sessions. Redding recorded the best time in FP1 on Friday,
  while Gerloff was quickest in FP3 on Saturday morning with Redding
  behind him in second place. The atmosphere was full of optimism before
  the Superpole, but numerous falls and yellow flags in qualifying
  repeatedly put the brakes on the hunt for fast lap times. Gerloff was
  the best-placed BMW rider in eighth. As riders ahead of him saw their
  fastest laps annulled, he moved up to sixth on the grid. Baz started
  race one from 13th, with Redding and van der Mark 15th and 18th.

Race one on Saturday afternoon developed into a tyre lottery. Rain
  set in at the start, but the expectation was that it would ease off
  and the track would quickly dry out. So, the key question on the wet
  grid was: which tyres should we start the race on? Redding selected
  wet-weather tyres on the grid, but headed for the pits after the
  warm-up lap to put on intermediates. This meant he had to start at the
  back of the field, from the pit lane. However, Redding ploughed
  through the field with a great chasing performance, spending time in
  second place before crossing the line in fourth after 22 laps. Baz and
  his crew chose intermediates and the French rider reached the
  finishing line in tenth place. Van der Mark played it safe by starting
  on wet-weather tyres and then pitted after a few laps to switch to
  slicks. He scored points in his first race after a long,
  injury-enforced break, finishing 13th. However, Gerloff endured some
  bad luck. Running in seventh place, he slid on a wet patch and took a tumble.

It rained once again on Saturday night and Sunday morning, but the
  track dried out in time for the Superpole Race before noon. Gerloff
  finished the race in ninth, while Baz, Redding and van der Mark
  crossed the finishing line in 12th, 13th and 14th positions.

Rain clouds re-appeared before the start of the second main race on
  Sunday afternoon, but conditions remained dry for the race. Redding
  started from 15th and produced another great chasing performance in
  the dry as he moved up to eighth. Baz also progressed through the
  field, reaching the top eight for a time and taking the chequered flag
  in 10th after 22 laps. Van der Mark finished 15th to score another
  point. Gerloff suffered more misfortune: he made a great start from
  ninth on the grid, only to fall on lap one. He was able to rejoin the
  race, headed to the pits for a brief repair stop and finished in 20th.

The WorldSBK is now taking a summer break. The ninth round of the
  2023 season will take place on 8th to 10th September in Magny-Cours, France.

“It
  was a very mixed weekend, both in terms of results and weather. And
  these were partly related. For Michael, his comeback weekend
  unfortunately started negatively. In FP2, there was a mechanical issue
  that caused a crash. Fortunately, he was okay and from Saturday
  onwards things went smoothly in technical terms, and it was good that
  he could do several laps to assess where he stands and what he needs
  to work on. He finished all the races and scored points. We are very
  satisfied with that. For Scott, we were very strong in the free
  practices, however qualifying was difficult. The session is short and
  tight, and with the rule that lap times get cancelled with yellow
  flags, even with a strong pace, it’s possible to come up short. And
  that was the case with Scott. However, he made a good decision in the
  first race and came in again before the start to switch to
  intermediates. He secured an extremely strong fourth place. In the
  second main race, he climbed from P15 to eighth. He had a solid pace
  again, but starting from the back is still challenging. Garrett showed
  strong lap times in the free practices and had a very good qualifying
  with P6. Unfortunately, he couldn’t capitalise on the Superpole
  position in the first race due to a crash in the wet conditions. In
  the Superpole race, he stayed within the crucial top nine. He also had
  a great start in race two, but unfortunately, he went into neutral and
  crashed. Although he continued with very strong lap times, he was
  outside the points. Loris had a consistently solid weekend, and we can
  be satisfied with his two top-10 results. Now we head into the summer
  break, and in early September, we hope for a strong start to the final
  stretch of the season in Magny-Cours.”

“Overall the weekend was pretty
  good. We were first on Friday in mixed conditions and second in FP3.
  We were a bit more up there which was nice. Obviously we had to take a
  gamble in different conditions but it paid off. I was a bit upset with
  the result in this morning’s Superpole race. We had an issue,
  something was not quite right, an it made it difficult to stop the
  bike. It was hard because I wanted to try and finish in the top nine,
  to have a better start position for race two, and knew I had better
  pace than that but I just couldn’t do it, so it was frustrating. In
  race two, I wanted to try and bounce back and show my potential again
  as a rider, so to come from 15th and have a good pace in the second
  half of the race was good. It took me a while to get through a few
  guys and to get a clear track but I felt I was riding well and the
  pace was good. I think we were 13 seconds off the leader of which I
  was probably lost three, four, five in the beginning. It wasn’t ideal
  but I felt strong and the main thing is I enjoyed riding the bike today.”

): “It wasn’t a bad weekend. We have
  now had two good weekends in a row and I don’t know when yhis was last
  the case. I am happy as I didn’t crash and nobody took me out, so
  hopefully we have left the bad luck behind us. I am even more proud
  and happy of the job we did here because in Imola, I felt really good
  from the beginning. Here I didn’t feel comfortable on Friday or
  yesterday and was struggling a lot in some parts of the track. But we
  managed to improve the bike and that on a track where we struggled
  last year. So yes, it was good. My Superpole race was okay. I was
  struggling a lot to overtake Dominique Aegerter but we were not in the
  top nine and that is what matters in the sprint race. Race two was
  good. I had a really strong start and then I was trying to go at my
  pace, to not make any mistakes and I be there at the end. I struggled
  a bit with arm pump and I was still in pain from my left shoulder
  since the crash in Imola. But I am happy. In the top ten again. I was
  just a bit disappointed to lose the top nine on the last lap.”

“This Sunday was OK for
  me. My priority was to do as many laps as possible. Of course you also
  want to go as fast as possible too. In this morning’s Superpole race,
  I was happy. I had quite a good rhythm but it was not more than ten
  laps. Then in race two, I had a good start but was a bit too cautious
  into turn one and then I was behind a big group. I stayed with them
  for a while but I was pushing too much to stay with them so I backed
  off because I knew I had to do as many laps as possible. It was a
  lonely race but we had to finish, we had to do the laps. So I am happy
  with the result. Overall, it’s nice to be back.”

“I was happy to stay in the
  top nine in the Superpole race. I had a really good start in race two
  but unfortunately, the bike went into neutral going into turn one and
  I ended up crashing. That was the end of the weekend and I am just sad
  about it. I know our potential is really good so it makes it even more
  frustrating but after the summer break we will come back stronger in France.”
